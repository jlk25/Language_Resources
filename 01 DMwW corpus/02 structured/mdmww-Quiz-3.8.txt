Question 10
Now that you’ve got everything set up in the Experimenter there’s one final thing that is easy to do, and very instructive; which is to examine the speed of the classifier algorithms you’ve been investigating.
Let’s think about it first.
You have been evaluating 5 methods: ZeroR, OneR, PART, JRip and J48. Which 2 do you think are the fastest for training?
ZeroR and PART
ZeroR and OneR
J48 and OneR
---
Correct answer(s):
ZeroR and OneR
---
Feedback correct:
These methods are by far the simplest

Question 11
Which 2 do you think are the fastest for testing?
ZeroR and JRip
ZeroR and OneR
J48 and OneR
---
Correct answer(s):
ZeroR and OneR
---
Feedback correct:
Once again, these methods are by far the simplest

Question 12
Do you think J48 is faster than PART for training?
Yes
No
---
Correct answer(s):
Yes
---
Feedback correct:
J48 produces just one decision tree whereas PART produces several

Question 13
Do you think JRip is faster than PART for testing?
Yes
No
---
Correct answer(s):
Yes
---
Feedback correct:
JRip produces smaller rule sets, which are quicker to test

Question 14
In the Experimenter, select UserCPU_Time_training as the “Comparison field”. Set the Mean Precision under “Output Format” to 6 (decimal places), and check Show Average (also under “Output Format”).
Perform the test and look at the average training time taken by these classifiers: ZeroR, OneR, PART, JRip and J48. What order do they come in?
---
Correct answer(s):
ZeroR
oneR
J48
PART
JRIP
---
Feedback correct:
(Note that the times might differ slightly on your computer, so what’s correct for me may not necessarily be correct for you.)

Question 15
Change the Comparison field to UserCPU_Time_testing. What order do they come in now (fastest to slowest)?
JRip, OneR, J48, PART, ZeroR
J48, ZeroR, OneR, JRip, PART
ZeroR, J48, OneR, JRip, PART
ZeroR, J48, JRip, OneR, PART
J48, ZeroR, JRip, OneR, PART
JRip, OneR, J48, ZeroR, PART
None of the above
---
Correct answer(s):
None of the above
---
Feedback correct:
It’s hard to get this question wrong! I was surprised to find many different permutations of UserCPU_Time_testing ordering when I tried this on different computers. So all answers are marked correct!!!
