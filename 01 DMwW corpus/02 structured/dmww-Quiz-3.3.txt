OneR vs. the baseline
Question 1
Perform 10-fold cross-validation using ZeroR and OneR. Which classifier achieves higher accuracy?
OneR
ZeroR
Both have the same accuracy
---
Correct answer(s):
OneR
---
Feedback correct:
A single rule outperforms ZeroR by a large margin on the iris dataset (92% vs 33%).

Question 2
Which attribute does OneR use for generating the rule in the previous experiment, when using the full dataset?
sepallength
sepalwidth
petallength
petalwidth
class
---
Correct answer(s):
petalwidth
---
Feedback correct:
The Classifier model output prints details of the model that is generated on the full training set. In case of OneR, it prints the rule.
---
Feedback incorrect:
“Class” is not really an attribute, it’s what’s being predicted.

Question 3
Could there be a dataset for which ZeroR outperforms OneR?
No. OneR always outperforms ZeroR.
Yes. ZeroR sometimes outperforms OneR.
---
Correct answer(s):
Yes. ZeroR sometimes outperforms OneR.
---
Feedback correct:
If the class distribution is skewed or limited data is available, predicting the majority class can yield better results than basing a rule on a single attribute. This happens with the nominal weather dataset, weather.nominal.arff.

Question 4
Could there be a dataset for which ZeroR outperforms OneR when evaluated on the training data?
No
Yes
---
Correct answer(s):
---
Feedback correct:
OneR always outperforms (or, at worst, equals) ZeroR when evaluated on the training data. (Of course, evaluating on the training data doesn’t reflect performance on independent test data.)

Question 4
Could there be a dataset for which ZeroR outperforms OneR when evaluated on the training data?
No
Yes
