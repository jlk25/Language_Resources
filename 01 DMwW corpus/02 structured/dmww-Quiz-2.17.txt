Question 1
What is the mean value of the accuracy with random seeds of 11, 12, 13, 14, and 15?
79.8%
95.4%
95.6%
95.7%
---
Correct answer(s):
---
Feedback correct:
The random seeds generated the following accuracies: 96.1, 96.3, 94.5, 95.7, 96.1. This results in a mean of 95.7%.

Question 2
What is the standard deviation of the accuracy?
0.60%
0.65%
0.73%
0.74%
---
Correct answer(s):
---
Feedback correct:
The random seeds generate the following raw accuracies: 96.0667, 96.2667, 94.4667, 95.6667, 96.1333. This results in a standard deviation of 0.7354%.
(Note: you should divide by 4, not 5, otherwise you will get the smaller estimate of 0.66%. Technically, you are calculating the standard deviation of a “sample” rather than a “population”. If you are using Excel, use STDEV.S, not STDEV.P.)

Feedback incorrect:
The random seeds generate the following (rounded) accuracies: 96.1, 96.3, 94.5, 95.7, 96.1. This results in a standard deviation of 0.728%.
However, you should really average the raw accuracies, not the rounded ones. That leads you to a slightly different answer …

Question 3
When you performed the above experiment, how many times did Weka run the J48 algorithm?
5
6
50
55
60
---
Correct answer(s):
---
Feedback correct:
Each 10-fold cross-validation involves running J48 eleven times, once for each fold and once at the end, on the entire dataset. And Weka did this five times.

Question 4
With the same dataset, select Percentage split as the test option with 90% as the parameter. Evaluate J48 with the same seed values as before:
11, 12, 13, 14, 15
What is the mean of the accuracy?
80.5%
96.2%
96.5%
96.6%
---
Correct answer(s):
---
Feedback correct:
The random seeds generated the following accuracies: 98.7, 95.3, 98.0, 96.0, 94.7. This results in a mean of 96.5%.

Question 5
What is the standard deviation of the accuracy?
1.25%
1.55%
1.73%
1.81%
---
Correct answer(s):
---
Feedback correct:
The random seeds generated the following accuracies: 98.7, 95.3, 98.0, 96.0, 94.7. This results in a standard deviation of 1.73%.

Question 6
When you performed the above experiment, how many times did Weka run the J48 algorithm?

---
Correct answer(s):
---
Feedback correct:
For each of the five runs Weka executes J48 twice, one on the 90% training set and again on the whole dataset (just as in cross-validation).
---
Feedback incorrect:
Not quite correct. For each run Weka executes J48 twice, one on the 90% training set and again on the whole dataset (just as in cross-validation).
