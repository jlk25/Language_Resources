Investigating the python-weka-wrapper library 
Question 1
What library does the python-weka-wrapper use for plotting?
jFreeChart
matplotlib
Plotly
PyQtGraph
---
Correct answer(s):
matplotlib
---
Feedback correct:
This is mentioned in a comment in pww-display_roc-multiple.py when importing the weka.plot.classifiers module

Question 2
What python-weka-wrapper module is used to plot classifier errors generated by linear regression?
weka.plot.graph
weka.plot.classifiers
weka.plot.dataset
---
Correct answer(s):
weka.plot.classifiers
---
Feedback correct:
The script pww-crossvalidate_classifier-errors-bubbles.py uses the weka.plot.classifiers module

Question 3
The remaining questions are for people who intend to actually use the python-weka-wrapper.
Answer them by consulting the python-weka-wrapper home page and documentation, or by doing a Google search on the documentation site (include “site:pythonhosted.org/python-weka-wrapper/” in your search).
What Python library does the python-weka-wrapper use for communicating with the Java Virtual Machine (JVM)?
javabridge
jep
jpype
---
Correct answer(s):
javabridge
---
Feedback correct:
You can find this on the python-weka-wrapper home page

Question 4
How do you set command-line options for the classifier object cls in the python-weka-wrapper?
cls.options = “–A 42”
cls.options = [“–A”, “42”]
cls.setOptions(“–A 42”)
cls.setOptions([“–A”, “42”])
---
Correct answer(s):
cls.options = [“–A”, “42”]
---
Feedback correct:
You can discover this with a Google search for “option handling site:pythonhosted.org/python-weka-wrapper/”
---
Feedback incorrect:
This is what you would use in Jython, but not in the python-weka-wrapper

Question 5
What method of the python-weka-wrapper’s Evaluation class is used to test a built classifier on a dataset?
crossvalidate_model
evaluate_model
test_model
---
Correct answer(s):
test_model
---
Feedback correct:
You can discover this with a Google search for “test_model site:pythonhosted.org/python-weka-wrapper/”

Question 6
How do you start up the JVM with a custom heapsize of 512MB?
jvm.start(max_heap_size=”512m”)
You can’t
jvm.heap_size = “512m”
---
Correct answer(s):
jvm.start(max_heap_size=”512m”)
---
Feedback correct:
You can discover this with a Google search for “jvm.start site:pythonhosted.org/python-weka-wrapper/”

Question 7
Can you add your own jar files to the JVM that is used by the python-weka-wrapper?
Yes
No
---
Correct answer(s):
Yes
---
Feedback correct:
Here’s how to do it

Question 8
Which of the following does the distribution_for_instance method used for classifiers return?
Hint: Use the index link at the very right of the python-weka-wrapper documentation page to locate distribution_for_instance; you will have to do a further web search to determine what the “Return type” means.
dictionary
list
numpy array
---
Correct answer(s):
numpy array
