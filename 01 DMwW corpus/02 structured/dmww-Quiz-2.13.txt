Comparing with the baseline
Question 1
The iris.arff dataset consists of three classes (Iris-setosa, Iris-versicolor, Iris-virginica), with 50 instances each. What is the accuracy of ZeroR on this dataset when testing on the training set?
10%
33%
50%
66%
---
Correct answer(s):
33%
---
Feedback correct:
It’s a tie, so ZeroR chooses one of the three classes as the the majority class and always predicts it, achieving a success rate of 50/150, or 33.3%.

Question 2
In practice, what is ZeroR’s success rate on the iris dataset when evaluated using the default (66%) Percentage split?
29%
31%
71%
96%
---
Correct answer(s):
29%
---
Feedback correct:
There is some statistical variation from the expected figure because the training and test sets are randomly sampled. (Note: to get this result, Weka’s random seed should have its default value of 1).
---
Feedback incorrect:
Is your seed value set to 2 or 3? Make sure the default seed is set at a value of 1.
---
Feedback incorrect:
Make sure you are looking that the Correctly Classified Instances and not the Incorrectly Classified Instances.

Question 3
Open the glass.arff dataset, go to the Classify tab, and use Percentage split with the default value of 66% as the evaluation method.
What is ZeroR’s accuracy (in percent)?
27%
28%
33%
34%
---
Correct answer(s):
27%
---
Feedback correct:
(Weka gives the result as 27.3973%)
---
Feedback incorrect:
Did you use percentage split (66%) and random seed of 1?

Question 4
What is J48’s accuracy on the glass dataset, using default parameter values?
38%
57%
58%
62%
---
Correct answer(s):
58%
---
Feedback correct:
(Weka gives the result as 57.5342%)
---
Feedback incorrect:
Did you use Percentage split (66%) and random seed of 1?

Question 5
What is NaiveBayes’ accuracy on the glass dataset, using default parameter values?
39%
43%
49%
51%
---
Correct answer(s):
49%
---
Feedback correct:
(Weka gives the result as 49.3%)
---
Feedback incorrect:
Did you use Percentage split (66%) and random seed of 1?

Question 6
Open the segment-challenge.arff dataset, go to the Classify tab, and evaluate using segment-test.arff as the test set.
What is ZeroR’s accuracy?
12%
14%
16%
88%
---
Correct answer(s):
---
Feedback correct:
(Weka gives the result as 11.6049%)
---
Feedback incorrect:
Did you use Supplied test set?
---
Feedback incorrect:
Are you looking at the Incorrectly classified Instances instead of the Correctly classified Instances?

Question 6
Open the segment-challenge.arff dataset, go to the Classify tab, and evaluate using segment-test.arff as the test set.
What is ZeroR’s accuracy?
12%

Question 7
What is IBk’s accuracy for segment-challenge evaluated on segment-test, using default parameter values?
31%
95%
96%
98%
---
Correct answer(s):
---
Feedback correct:
(Weka gives the result as 95.8025 percent)
---
Feedback incorrect:
