Optimizing IBk
Question 1
In the Explorer, determine the optimal parameter value for IBk between 1 and 10 for the breast-cancer.arff dataset using the CVParameterSelection meta-learning scheme with the CVParameter string set to “K 1 10 10”. What is it?
1
2
4
9
---
Correct answer(s):
4

Question 2
Set up the Experimenter to compare IBk with its default parameter of 1 with the optimal value between 1 and 10 found using the CVParameterSelection meta-learning scheme.
Use these 4 datasets: credit-g.arff, diabetes.arff, glass.arff, and ionosphere.arff. Note: the optimal parameter value will vary from one dataset to another, so be sure to set up the Experimenter to determine it individually for each dataset.
