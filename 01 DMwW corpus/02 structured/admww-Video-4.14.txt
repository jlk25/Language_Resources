Image classification
Mike Mayo shows that with appropriate features, Weka can be used to classify images. The imageFilters package processes image files to extract features, and implements 10 different feature sets. You need to put all your images into a single folder and create an ARFF file with two attributes: the image filename (a string) and its class (nominal). The image filters appear as unsupervised instance filters, under imageFilter. One is the ColorLayoutFilter, another is the EdgeHistogramFilter. Each adds several attributes to the ARFF file. Furthermore, they can be used in sequence, each filter adding its own attributes.
