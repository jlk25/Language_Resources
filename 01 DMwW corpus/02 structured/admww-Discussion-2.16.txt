Reflect on this week’s Big Question
This week’s Big Question is, “How can you mine continuous data streams?”
We promised that by the end you’d be able to explain, at a high level, how decision trees can be modified incrementally, and compare the performance of incremental and non-incremental decision tree algorithms. You’d be able to use both Weka’s MOA package and the MOA system itself, which contains stream-oriented implementation of many packages and allows different evaluation techniques designed for incremental operation. You’d know the difference between periodic holdout and prequential evaluation, and about adaptive windowing and how to use it for change detection. You’d also have some experience of sentiment analysis using Twitter data.
Well, what do you think now? It’s true that we haven’t discussed how to connect sensors to a data mining program, nor how to deploy models that affect the world on a continuous basis. The incremental algorithms that we have described are real-time in principle, because they update their models in a time that is independent of the volume of data already seen, but we haven’t discussed implementation details. Nevertheless you’ve learned a lot about mining continuous data streams, despite the fact that everything we’ve done has used either data generators (which are potentially infinite) or data already stored in computer files (which are not).
