Using filters
Question 1
How many attributes does the anneal dataset have?
17
39
772
898
---
Correct answer(s):
39
---
Feedback correct:
This is shown in the “Current relation” box on the “Preprocess” panel.
---
Feedback incorrect:
That was for the labor dataset. You should have loaded the anneal dataset.
---
Feedback incorrect:
That’s the number of instances, not the number of attributes, as shown in the “Current relation” box on the “Preprocess” panel.

Question 2
Apply the unsupervised attribute filter RemoveUseless. How many attributes does the anneal dataset have now?
30
32
36
39
---
Correct answer(s):
32
---
Feedback correct:
Select the filter by choosing unsupervised, attribute, and then RemoveUseless.
---
Feedback incorrect:
Select the filter by choosing unsupervised, attribute, and then RemoveUseless.
---
Feedback incorrect:
Select the filter by choosing unsupervised, attribute, and then RemoveUseless.
Don’t forget to APPLY the filter once you have selected it (Apply button)!

Question 3
Identify one of the attributes that was removed by clicking Undo and then Apply. Now figure out why it was removed.
The attribute name was too short
Only one of the attribute’s values actually appears in the dataset
The attribute only had two possible values
---
Correct answer(s):
Only one of the attribute’s values actually appears in the dataset
---
Feedback correct:
An attribute that has the same value for all instances in the dataset doesn’t yield any additional information, and Weka therefore deems it to be useless.
---
Feedback incorrect:
The attribute’s name has no influence.
---
Feedback incorrect:
The number of possible values has no influence.

Question 4
Open the glass.arff dataset (which was downloaded when you installed Weka). Apply the unsupervised attribute filter Normalize. What is the new range (i.e. minimum and maximum) of the Na attribute?
[–1, 1]
[0, 1]
[–∞, ∞]
---
Correct answer(s):
[0, 1]
---
Feedback correct:
The Normalize filter scales attributes into the range [0, 1].

Question 5
Undo the effect of the Normalize filter and bring up its configuration panel. Set the scale to 3 and the translation option to 1. Apply the filter again. What is the Na attribute’s range now?
[1, 4]
[0, 1]
[1, 3]
---
Correct answer(s):
[1, 4]

Question 6
Undo the change and check that you have reverted to the original dataset. Now apply the unsupervised attribute filter Standardize. What are the new mean and standard deviation of the K attribute?
The mean is 0.497 and the standard deviation is 0.652
The mean is –0.762 and the standard deviation is 8.76
The mean is 1 and the standard deviation is 0
The mean is 0 and the standard deviation is 1
The mean is 1.518 and the standard deviation is 0.003
---
Correct answer(s):
The mean is 0 and the standard deviation is 1
---
Feedback correct:
The Standardize filter alters the range of an attribute to give it a mean of 0 and standard deviation of 1.

Question 7
Undo all changes to the glass dataset again. Now determine which attribute set gives the highest classification accuracy using J48.
removing Fe, Si, Al, K
removing Fe, Mg, Rl
removing Fe, Si, Mg, K
---
Correct answer(s):
removing Fe, Si, Al, K

Question 7
Undo all changes to the glass dataset again. Now determine which attribute set gives the highest classification accuracy using J48.
removing Fe, Si, Al, K
removing Fe, Mg, Rl
removing Fe, Si, Mg, K
