Feedback correct:
5x5.58 + 1x25.54 = 53.44

Question 3
What is the total weighted cost for cost-sensitive classification (CostSensitiveClassifier with Naive Bayes and minimizeExpectedCost = true)?

Feedback correct:
5x5.53 + 1x25.53 = 53.18.
Cost-sensitive learning (Q.2) and cost-sensitive classification (this question) give pretty well the same result with Naive Bayes. Both do much better than plain Naive Bayes (Q.1).

Question 4
What is the total weighted cost for plain J48?

Feedback correct:
5x6.39 + 1x34.53 = 66.48

Question 6
What is the total weighted cost for J48 with cost-sensitive classification?

Feedback correct:
5x11.02 + 1x22.64 = 77.74
For J48, cost-sensitive learning (Q.5) gives a better result than cost-sensitive classification (this question). Both do much better than plain J48 (Q.4).

Question 7
What is the total weighted cost for J48 with cost-sensitive classification with bagging?

Feedback correct:
5x5.23 + 1x33.84 = 59.99
Bagging improves the result of cost-sensitive classification using J48.
