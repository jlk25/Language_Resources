Question 1
Using the Explorer, determine the percentage accuracy of Naive Bayes on covtype.small, evaluated on the training set.
65%
66%
67%

Correct answer(s):
66%
---
Feedback correct:
(Weka gives the result as 65.8%)
---
Feedback incorrect:
Are you sure you evaluated on the training set? â€“ this is the result you get when using cross-validation.

Question 2
Using the Explorer, determine the percentage accuracy of Naive Bayes on the same dataset, evaluated by cross-validation.
65%
66%

Correct answer(s):
65%

Feedback correct:
(Weka gives the result as 65.42%)
---
Feedback incorrect:
The cross-validation accuracy will not be greater than the accuracy when evaluated on the training set, will it?

Question 3
Using the Simple CLI, determine the percentage accuracy of NaiveBayesUpdateable, evaluated on the training set.

Feedback correct:
The appropriate command is
java weka.classifiers.bayes.NaiveBayesUpdateable 
        -t covtype.small.arff  -T covtype.small.arff
NaiveBayesUpdateable gives the same result as NaiveBayes (65.8%).
I hope you used the Simple CLI, not the Explorer!

Feedback incorrect:
The appropriate command is
java weka.classifiers.bayes.NaiveBayesUpdateable 
        -t covtype.small.arff  -T covtype.small.arff
Be sure to specify the training set as the test file for evaluation.

Feedback incorrect:
The appropriate command is
java weka.classifiers.bayes.NaiveBayesUpdateable 
        -t covtype.small.arff  -T covtype.small.arff

Feedback correct:
The appropriate command is
java weka.classifiers.bayes.NaiveBayesUpdateable
        -t covtype.small.arff
Note that cross-validation is the default option for evaluation.
NaiveBayesUpdateable gives exactly the same result as NaiveBayes (65.42%).
