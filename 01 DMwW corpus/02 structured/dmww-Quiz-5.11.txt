Question 5
When visualizing the slug data in Weka, it seems from the graph of weight versus length that a logarithmic transform of one or both attributes may help the performance of linear regression. This can be done using Weka’s AddExpression filter. Figure out how to use this filter. What is the mean and standard deviation of the new attribute that is obtained by applying a logarithmic transform to the existing length attribute?

Mean: 2.2
Mean: 2.3
Mean: 3.6
Mean: 42.1
StdDev: 0.62

Correct answer(s):
Mean: 3.6
StdDev: 0.62

Question 6
Apply a logarithmic transform to both the length and weight attributes in the slug data. Use linear regression to predict log weight from log length, and determine the correlation coefficient using 10-fold cross-validation. What is it?

Question 7
Download the schizo.arff dataset and run ZeroR, OneR, J48 and SMO to predict the class (schizophrenic/non-schizophrenic), evaluating using 10-fold cross-validation. What order do the methods come in, from least accurate to most accurate?
---
Correct answer(s):

Question 8
The predictions of OneR and J48 on the schizo dataset in the last question seem suspiciously good. In fact, they are anomalous because of the existence of one particular attribute. Identify this attribute, remove it, and test the four methods again (also using 10-fold cross-validation). What order do they come in now, from least accurate to most accurate?
---
Correct answer(s):

Question 9
With the original schizo dataset (before the attribute was removed), two of the classifiers were overfitting badly. Which two?

Question 10
Using 10-fold cross-validation, evaluate the percentage classification accuracy of IBk (k = 3) on the soybean dataset when the class value of all instances (both training and test instances) is corrupted by 25% noise using Weka’s AddNoise filter.
40%
56%
60%
63%
64%
---
Correct answer(s):
64%

Question 11
Restore the original soybean.arff dataset and evaluate the performance of J48, selecting Percentage split as the test option with 90% as the parameter, using the random seed values 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5. What is the mean and standard deviation of the percentage classification accuracy?

Question 13
Reset the random seed value back to 1. Open the vote.arff dataset, run the four classifiers IBk, J48, Logistic, and SMO, and record the classification accuracy using 10-fold cross-validation. What order do the algorithms come in, from least accurate to most accurate?
IBk = Logistic < J48 < SMO
Logistic < IBk < J48 = SMO
J48 = IBk < Logistic < SMO
IBk < Logistic = SMO < J48
---
Correct answer(s):
IBk < Logistic = SMO < J48

They all have the same mean absolute error
They all have some unclassified instances
They all produce the same classification accuracy

Correct answer(s):
They all produce the same classification accuracy

Question 15
The default configuration of AdaBoostM1 is 10 boosting iterations using the DecisionStump classifier. Performance might improve if 100 iterations were used instead. And it might improve if you kept to 10 iterations but used J48 instead of DecisionStump.
