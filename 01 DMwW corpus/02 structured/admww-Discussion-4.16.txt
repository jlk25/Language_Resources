Reflect on this week’s Big Question
This week’s Big Question is, “Can you distribute Weka jobs over several machines?”
Of course, as we said when introducing it, the answer is “yes”!
We promised that by the end, you’d be acquainted with Distributed Weka, its design goals, its use of the map-reduce idea for breaking computations down for parallel implementation, and – most importantly – how to install it and use it from the Knowledge Flow interface. Even though you’re running it on a single desktop machine, each of the individual cores in the CPU is treated as a separate processing node.
Here is a good place to discuss what you have learned with fellow learners.
