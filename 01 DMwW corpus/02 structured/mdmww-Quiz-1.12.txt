Comparing classifiers 
Question 1
For one (and only one) of the datasets, some schemes significantly outperform J48 (at the 5% level). Which dataset?
iris
breast-cancer
credit-g
diabetes
glass
ionosphere
---
Correct answer(s):
credit-g
---
Feedback correct:
NaiveBayes, Logistic, and SMO significantly outperform J48 on the german_credit dataset – and no method outperforms it significantly on any other dataset. (Look for the “v”s, not the asterisks.)

Question 2
One of the classifiers is not significantly different from J48 on any dataset. Which classifier?
NaiveBayes
IBk
Logistic
SMO
AdaBoostM1
---
Correct answer(s):
IBk

Question 3
One of the classifiers is significantly better than J48 on exactly one dataset, and significantly worse than J48 on exactly one other dataset. Which classifier?
NaiveBayes
IBk
Logistic
SMO
AdaBoostM1
---
Correct answer(s):
Logistic
---
Feedback correct:
Logistic outperforms J48 significantly on the german_credit dataset, and underperforms it significantly on the breast-cancer dataset.

Question 4
Change the analysis parameters to compare the various classifiers with OneR instead of with J48. (You can do this on the “Analyse” panel without re-running the experiment.)
There’s one dataset on which all classifiers significantly outperform OneR. Which dataset?
iris
breast-cancer
credit-g
diabetes
glass
ionosphere
---
Correct answer(s):
credit-g
---
Feedback correct:
Even ZeroR outperforms OneR significantly on this dataset!

Question 5
Which classifier significantly outperforms OneR on the largest number of datasets?
NaiveBayes
IBk
Logistic
SMO
AdaBoostM1
---
Correct answer(s):
AdaBoostM1
---
Feedback correct:
AdaBoostM1 outperforms OneR significantly on 5 datasets. However, on the remaining dataset (Glass), AdaBoostM1 significantly underperforms OneR!

Question 6
Change the analysis parameters to compare the various classifiers with SMO instead of with OneR.
Which classifier significantly outperforms SMO on the largest number of datasets?
NaiveBayes
J48
IBk
Logistic
AdaBoostM1
---
Correct answer(s):
J48
---
Feedback correct:
J48 significantly outperforms SMO on two datasets, breast-cancer and Glass.

Question 7
Which other classifier significantly outperforms SMO on at least one dataset (as well as J48)?
NaiveBayes
IBk
Logistic
SMO
AdaBoostM1
---
Correct answer(s):
IBk
---
Feedback correct:
IBk significantly outperforms SMO on the Glass dataset.
