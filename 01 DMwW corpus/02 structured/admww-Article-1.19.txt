Avenues for further investigation
You can perform much more experimentation in search of a good model!
For example, we have not examined the effects of parameter changes in either the classifiers or the preprocessing techniques (except for the Savitzky-Golay window size).
One problem faced in all application development is knowing when a result is good enough to be useful in practice. In our experience, the correlation coefficient needs to increase to 0.95â€“0.99 for this problem. Our best result in this activity is 0.87, still a long way off. Another important factor that we have not explored is the effect of outliers in regression problems. Filtering out outlier instances can make a huge difference to performance.
