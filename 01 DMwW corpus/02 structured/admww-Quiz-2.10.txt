Streaming classifiers and evolving streams
Question 1
We begin with a non-evolving scenario.
The RandomRBF data generator first creates a random set of centers for each class, each comprising a weight, a central point per attribute, and a standard deviation. It then generates instances by choosing a center at random (taking the weights into consideration), which determines the class, and randomly choosing attribute values and an offset from the center. Finally the overall vector is scaled to a length that is randomly sampled from a Gaussian distribution around the center.
What are the accuracies of Naive Bayes and Hoeffding Tree on a RandomRBFGenerator stream of 1,000,000 instances with default values, using Prequential evaluation and the BasicClassificationPerformanceEvaluator?

Question 2
MOA’s Hoeffding Tree algorithm can use different prediction methods at the leaves.
The default is an adaptive Naive Bayes method, but a majority class classifier can be used instead by specifying
–l (trees.HoeffdingTree –l MC)
You can set this up in MOA’s Configure interface (you need to scroll down).
What is the accuracy of the Hoeffding Tree when a majority class classifier is used at the leaves?

Question 4
Now let’s use an evolving data stream.
The RandomRBFGeneratorDrift generator has a speedChange parameter that controls the rate of movement of the centroids.
What are the accuracies of Naive Bayes, Hoeffding Tree, and OzaBag on a RandomRBFGeneratorDrift stream of 1,000,000 instances with speed change of 0.001, again using Prequential evaluation with the BasicClassificationPerformanceEvaluator?

Hoeffding Tree: 57.6%
OzaBag: 63.5%

Question 5
The Hoeffding Adaptive Tree adapts to changes in the data stream by constructing tentative “alternative branches” as preparation for changes, and switching to them if they become more accurate. A change detector with theoretical guarantees (ADWIN) is used to check whether to substitute alternative subtrees.
Two alternative methods for evolving data streams, both of which use ADWIN, are OzaBagAdwin and LeveragingBag.
What are the accuracies of these three techniques in the evolving data stream situation used in the last three questions?

Question 6
As well as data streams, MOA can also process ARFF files. Select ArffFileStream as the data stream and specify the filename in the arffFile field.
Use the covtypeNorm.arff dataset that we met earlier this week. The default location for files is the top level of the MOA installation folder – you will probably find the model files modelNB.moa and modelHT.moa that you made in the last quiz – so you should either copy the data file there or specify its full pathname.
Determine the accuracy of Naive Bayes, Hoeffding Tree, and LeveragingBag for this dataset, using Prequential evaluation with the BasicClassificationPerformanceEvaluator and a sampleFrequency of 10,000.
