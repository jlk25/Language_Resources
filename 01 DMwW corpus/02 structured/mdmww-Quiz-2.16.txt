Question 7
In the Explorer, test the the effect of different kinds of unsupervised discretization (10 bins) of the labor dataset by performing discretization using the Preprocess panel and executing J48 on the result, evaluating using cross-validation (default parameters).
What order do different settings of the equal width/equal frequency parameter and the binary-attribute parameter come in? (< denotes worse performance)
no discretization < equal frequency < equal width < equal frequency with binary attributes < equal width with binary attributes
no discretization < equal width < equal frequency < equal width with binary attributes < equal frequency with binary attributes
equal frequency < equal width < no discretization < equal frequency with binary attributes < equal width with binary attributes
equal width < equal frequency < no discretization < equal width with binary attributes < equal frequency with binary attributes
equal width < equal frequency < no discretization < equal frequency with binary attributes < equal width with binary attributes

equal width < equal frequency < no discretization < equal frequency with binary attributes < equal width with binary attributes

Question 8
Consider the following filtering configurations:
a. supervised discretization using the filtered classifier
b. supervised discretization without the filtered classifier
c. equal-width discretization (10 bins) using the filtered classifier
d. equal-width discretization (10 bins) without the filtered classifier
e. equal-frequency discretization (10 bins) using the filtered classifier
f. equal-frequency discretization (10 bins) without the filtered classifier 
Suppose you were to use each configuration on a particular dataset with a particular classifier, evaluated with cross-validation in the usual way. Which of the following best describes the performance you would expect? (> denotes better performance, = denotes exactly the same, ≈ denotes about the same.)
a ≈ b > c ≈ d > e ≈ f
a ≈ b > e ≈ f > c ≈ d
