Signal peptide prediction
Question 1
Analysis of signal peptide length reveals a fairly tight distribution around a mean of 24. Let’s see if position information helps when added to the residue context around the cleavage site.
Apply J48 to sigdata1.arff, using default settings for the classifier and 10-fold cross-validation. Compare results when the len feature is included to when it is left out. Does this feature improve the true-positive rate for both classes?
Yes
No
---
Correct answer(s):
No
---
Feedback correct:
The true positive rate is not improved for the yes class; it increases from 77.4% to 77.5% when the len feature is omitted.

Question 2
When the len feature is removed, which of the other features are not used in the final decision tree?
Select all the answers you think are correct.
pos–3
pos–2
pos–1
pos
pos+1
pos+2
pos+3
---
Correct answer(s):
pos
pos+2
pos+3

Question 3
If len is the only feature available to predict the class, what value does J48 choose as the constant for splitting the data?
13
14
15
16
17
18
---
Correct answer(s):
15

Question 4
Apply J48 to sigdata2.arff, which has the same features as the previous dataset, sigdata1, but three times as many negative instances as positive ones. Use default settings once again.
Remove the len feature. Does accuracy improve when compared to the same experiment run on sigdata1?
Yes
No
---
Correct answer(s):
Yes
---
Feedback correct:
The proportion of correctly classified instances improves from 78.8% to 82.7%.

Question 5
Does the true positive rate for the yes class improve with the additional negative instances?
Yes
No
---
Correct answer(s):
No
---
Feedback correct:
It drops from 77.5% to 52.3%.

Question 6
Which features have been used to predict the class in the tree built for the larger dataset?
Select all the answers you think are correct.
pos–3
pos–2
pos–1
pos
pos+1
pos+2
pos+3
---
Correct answer(s):
pos–3
pos–1
pos+1

Question 7
Does including the len feature significantly improve the true positive rate for this larger dataset?
Yes
No
---
Correct answer(s):
No
---
Feedback correct:
Including len changes the true positive rate from 52.3% to 52.8%, which is negligible.

Question 8
Biologists believe that physicochemical properties of the signal peptide play an important role in determining the cleavage site.
Some of these properties have been recorded in the sigdata3.arff file. Load this data and run J48 with the default settings.
Does the average true positive rate improve when using general physical properties instead of specific amino acids?
Yes
No
---
Correct answer(s):
Yes
---
Feedback correct:
The average true positive rate is 91.6%, much larger than anything we have seen before.

Question 9
Which physical property offers the most information gain?
pos
charge-3
small-1
h-region
cleave
---
Correct answer(s):
h-region
---
Feedback correct:
The J48 tree splits first on h-region.

Question 10
How many additional correct classifications do you get when the pos feature is included in the current dataset as opposed to if it is left out?
(Note: this feature is analogous to the len feature in earlier datasets.)
12
13
14
15
16
17
---
Correct answer(s):
12
---
Feedback correct:
Omitting pos reduces the number of correct classifications from 2573 to 2561

Question 11
Three times as many negative instances are included in sigdata4.arff as were available in the previous file, sigdata3. Load sigdata4.arff into WEKA and run J48 with default settings.
Does the true positive rate for the cleavage site (i.e. yes) drop as significantly as it did when more negative instances were added to the context data (i.e. sigdata2)?
Yes
No
---
Correct answer(s):
No
---
Feedback correct:
It drops from 91% to 85%, far smaller than the drop from 78% to 52% that we observed for sigdata2.

Question 12
Does the pos feature help to significantly increase accuracy when these additional negative instances are added to the physicochemical data?
Yes
No
---
Correct answer(s):
No
---
Feedback correct:
Removing pos affects the accuracy only marginally, from 94% to 93%.

Question 13
How much does the size of the tree (including leaves) reduce when pos is omitted from the sigdata4 feature set?
4
7
11
15
22
29
---
Correct answer(s):
22
---
Feedback correct:
It drops from 29 nodes to 7
---
Feedback incorrect:
That’s the difference in the number of leaves

Question 14
Apart from the h-region, which other feature offers the most information gain when the pos feature is omitted?
pos
charge-3
small-1
cleave
---
Correct answer(s):
small-1
---
Feedback correct:
The J48 decision tree involves only two attributes, h-region and small-1

Question 15
Given the four data sets (sigdata1, sigdata2, sigdata3 and sigdata4), and ignoring position/length information, which one yields a decision tree that is least likely to be overfitting the data and the most likely to be a perspicacious characterisation of the cleavage site?
sigdata1
sigdata2
sigdata3
sigdata4
---
Correct answer(s):
sigdata4
---
Feedback correct:
The J48 tree has only 7 nodes (including leaves), whereas for the other three datasets it has 143, 62, and 13 nodes respectively

Question 15
Given the four data sets (sigdata1, sigdata2, sigdata3 and sigdata4), and ignoring position/length information, which one yields a decision tree that is least likely to be overfitting the data and the most likely to be a perspicacious characterisation of the cleavage site?
sigdata1
sigdata2
sigdata3
sigdata4

Correct answer(s):
