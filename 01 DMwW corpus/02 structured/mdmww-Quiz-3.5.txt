Simple decision rules
Question 1
How many rules are there?

Correct answer(s):
5

Feedback correct:
J48 generates 5 rules for the weather.nominal.arff dataset:
    if outlook = sunny and humidity = high: no
    if outlook = sunny and humidity = normal: yes
    if outlook = overcast: yes
    if outlook = rainy and windy = TRUE: no
    if outlook = rainy and windy = FALSE: yes

Question 2
How many tests does the rule set involve?

Correct answer(s):
9

Feedback correct:
The rule set generated from J48’s tree for the weather.nominal.arff dataset  has 9 tests. Count the “=” signs!
    if outlook = sunny and humidity = high: no
    if outlook = sunny and humidity = normal: yes
    if outlook = overcast: yes
    if outlook = rainy and windy = TRUE: no
    if outlook = rainy and windy = FALSE: yes

Question 3
Deduce an equivalent set of smaller rules by assuming that the rules will be executed in order – i.e., that they form a decision list. How many tests does the decision list involve?

Feedback correct:
In the video, Ian showed this decision list:
outlook = sunny AND humidity = high -> no
outlook = sunny -> yes
outlook = overcast -> yes
windy = false -> yes
-> no
There are 5 rules and 5 tests (5 “=” signs)

Question 4
On the same dataset (weather.nominal.arff), run the PRISM algorithm for generating rules. How many rules and tests does it generate?
Select all the answers you think are correct.
5 rules
6 rules
7 rules
8 rules
8 tests
9 tests
10 tests
11 tests
---
Correct answer(s):
6 rules
11 tests
---
Feedback correct:
PRISM generates 6 rules for the weather.nominal.arff dataset
---
Feedback incorrect:
PRISM generates 6 rules for the weather.nominal.arff dataset

Question 5
If the order of the rules is shuffled, will PRISM’s rule set have the same effect?
Yes
No
---
Correct answer(s):
Yes

Question 6
As you can see, PRISM is not very successful on this example: it generates 6 rules with 11 tests, compared with the 5 rules and 9 tests generated by J48.
In fact, PRISM is only intended to illustrate the principle of rule generation using the separate-and-conquer method; it’s not a practically useful algorithm in general.
Generate the smallest possible rule set for the nominal weather data, by hand, that when executed in sequence classifies the training set perfectly. How many rules does it contain?

Feedback correct:
Here are 3 rules, involving 4 tests:
outlook = sunny AND humidity = high -> no
outlook = rainy AND windy = true -> no
-> yes

Question 7
Load the contact-lenses.arff dataset and use PRISM to generate a rule set. How many rules and tests does it contain?
Select all the answers you think are correct.
8 rules
9 rules
12 rules
9 tests
21 tests
26 tests
32 tests
---
Correct answer(s):
9 rules
26 tests

Question 8
Run J48 on the same dataset (contact-lenses.arff).
The tree it generates makes two errors on the training data, so alter J48’s configuration to force it to generate an exact tree (set minNumObj to 1 and unpruned to true).
Generate rules by reading them off the tree. How many rules and tests does this rule set contain?
Select all the answers you think are correct.
5 rules
9 rules
15 rules
15 tests
24 tests
30 tests

Correct answer(s):
9 rules
30 tests
