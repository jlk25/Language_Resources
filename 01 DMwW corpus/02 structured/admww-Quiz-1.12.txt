Looking at the textual output
Question 1
Go to the Forecast panel and forecast 12 time units ahead, using default values for all other parameters.
What’s the maximum passenger estimate over the 12 predicted values, and what month and year does it occur in?
464, in December 1961
661, in August 1961
690, in June 1961
690, in July 1961
691, in January 1962
710, in January 1962
---
Correct answer(s):
690, in July 1961

Question 2
Now remove leading instances with unknown lag values, and repeat.
What’s the maximum passenger estimate over the 12 predicted values, and what month and year does it occur in?
690, in July 1961
710, in July 1961
710, in August 1961
892, in October 1961
892, in December 1961
905, in July 1962
---
Correct answer(s):
710, in July 1961

Question 3
Now evaluate on the training data and 24 test instances.
What’s the maximum future passenger estimate from the end of the training data, and what month and year does it occur in? (Note: be sure to look from the end of the training data, not the test data.)
490, in June 1959
490, in August 1959
543, in July 1961
610, in September 1959
---
Correct answer(s):
490, in August 1959
---
Feedback incorrect:
Are you looking at predictions from the test data instead of the training data?

Question 4
What’s the maximum passenger estimate from the end of the test data, and what month and year does it occur in?
490, in August 1959
438, in June 1961
438, in July 1961
543, in July 1961
---
Correct answer(s):
543, in July 1961
---
Feedback incorrect:
Are you looking at predictions from the training data instead of the test data?

Question 5
You can change the textual options using the “Output options” (as opposed to “Graphing options”). The results all appear in the single textual output stream, rather than in different tabs as with the Graphing options.
By setting the “Output options” appropriately, what is the largest error in the training data for 1-step-ahead predictions, and what instance number does it occur on? (Note: the largest error may be negative.)
–12, on instance 42
–9, on instance 14
15, on instance 30
21, on instance 62
332, on instance 120
---
Correct answer(s):
21, on instance 62

Question 6
What is the largest error in the test data for 1-step-ahead predictions, and what instance number does it occur on? (Note: the largest error may be negative.)
–106, on instance 136
–91, on instance 134
–67, on instance 131
–56, on instance 122
336, on instance 121
---
Correct answer(s):
–106, on instance 136

Question 6
What is the largest error in the test data for 1-step-ahead predictions, and what instance number does it occur on? (Note: the largest error may be negative.)
–106, on instance 136
–91, on instance 134
–67, on instance 131
–56, on instance 122
336, on instance 121
