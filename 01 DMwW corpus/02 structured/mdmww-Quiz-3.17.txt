Clustering the Iris data
Question 1
How many clusters are generated?
1
2
3
4
5
---
Correct answer(s):
2
---
Feedback correct:
This is the default value for SimpleKMeans.

Question 2
Configure SimpleKMeans to generate 3 clusters and run again. How many instances are there in each cluster?
33
50
100
150
---
Correct answer(s):
50

Question 3
The result looks good – suspiciously good. Why do you think this is?
The class values are evenly distributed.
The class attribute is included in the data that is being clustered.
The number of clusters is optimal.
---
Correct answer(s):
The class attribute is included in the data that is being clustered.
---
Feedback correct:
The class value splits the instances into three natural clusters, corresponding to the three types of iris.

Question 4
Remove the class attribute (use “Ignore attributes” on the Cluster panel) and run SimpleKMeans again. How many instances are there in the clusters (in the order in which Weka shows them)?
39, 61, 50
50, 61, 39
61, 39, 50
61, 50, 39
---
Correct answer(s):
61, 50, 39

Question 5
Call the clusters generated by SimpleKMeans KM0, KM1, KM2, and make a note of the coordinates of the three cluster centers for future reference (to 1 decimal place).
Now run a second clusterer, XMeans. This is not in the Weka core but in a package called “XMeans”, which you will need to install first. (If you need help, refer to the instructions for adding PRISM earlier this week.)

Question 6
Constrain XMeans to generate 3 clusters and run again. How many instances are there in the clusters (in the order in which Weka shows them)?
48, 50, 52

Correct answer(s):
52, 48, 50

Question 7
Call the clusters XM0, XM1, XM2, and make a note of the coordinates of the three cluster centers for future reference (again to 1 decimal place).
Now run a third clusterer, EM. How many clusters are generated?

Question 8
Constrain EM to generate 3 clusters and run again. How many instances are there in the clusters (in the order in which Weka shows them)?
48, 50, 64
52, 50, 48
64, 50, 36

Question 9
Call the clusters EM0, EM1, EM2, and make a note of the coordinates of the three cluster centers (again to 1 decimal place).
Although the number of instances in each cluster is not exactly the same, there is a pretty good correspondence between the cluster centers for each of the three algorithms. What is the correspondence?
KM0 = XM0 = EM1
KM1 = XM2 = EM2
KM2 = XM1 = EM0
KM0 = XM0 = EM0
KM1 = XM1 = EM1
KM2 = XM2 = EM2
KM0 = XM0 = EM0
KM1 = XM1 = EM2
KM2 = XM2 = EM1
KM0 = XM1 = EM0
KM1 = XM2 = EM1
KM2 = XM0 = EM2
---
Correct answer(s):
KM0 = XM1 = EM0
KM1 = XM2 = EM1
KM2 = XM0 = EM2
