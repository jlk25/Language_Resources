Almost right. Itâ€™s not quite clear whether the class should be counted as an attribute or not. But for the purposes of this question we do count it as an attribute. So please try again.

Question 4
Does the class Iris-setosa tend to have high or low values of sepallength?
low
high

Correct answer(s):
---
Feedback correct:
When you select the class attribute, you see that Iris-setosa is depicted blue (hover your mouse over each colored bar). Selecting the sepallength attribute, you can see that blue is distributed towards the left, towards lower values.

Question 5
Does the class Iris-virginica tend to have high or low values of petalwidth?
low
high

Correct answer(s):

Question 5
Does the class Iris-virginica tend to have high or low values of petalwidth?
low
high

Correct answer(s):
high

Feedback correct:
When you select the class attribute, you see that class Iris-virginia is depicted in cyan (that is, light blue). Selecting the petalwidth attribute, you can see that cyan is distributed towards the right, towards higher values. (The petallength attribute gives an equally good indication of the class.)
