Neural networks, learning curves, and performance optimization
What are "neural networks" and how can I use them?
This week's first Big Question!

What are "neural networks" and how can I use them?
article
Simple neural networks 
The "Perceptron" is the simplest form of neural network.
The basic perceptron implements a linear decision boundary
... though modern improvements allow more complex boundaries.

Multilayer perceptrons 
Multilayer perceptrons are networks of perceptrons, with an input layer, an output layer, and (perhaps many) "hidden layers". They can implement arbitrary decision boundaries, but have practical limitations.

How much training data do I need? And how do I optimize all those parameters? 
This week's second Big Question! (two questions, really)
5.9
How much training data do I need? And how do I optimize all those parameters? 
article
Learning curves 
Find out how much data you need by plotting a learning curve using the "resample" filter (which allows sampling with or without replacement). You can avoid sampling the test set by using the FilteredClassifier.

Performance optimization 
Weka has several "wrapper" metalearners that optimize parameters for best performance:
CVParameterSelection, GridSearch, and ThresholdSelector.
You should avoid optimizing parameters manually: you're bound to overfit!

quiz
ARFF and XRFF 
The ARFF format can encode sparse data, weighted instances, and relational attributes.
Some Weka filters and classifiers take advantage of sparsity to reduce space and increase speed.
There's an XML version of ARFF, called XRFF.

There's no magic in data mining
There's no magic in data mining – no universal "best" method. It's an experimental science. You've learned a lot – but there's plenty more! Data mining is a powerful technology: please use it wisely.
