Examples of different error costs
Different error costs occur when the cost of mis-classifying an instance depends on its actual class and the class to which it has erroneously been assigned. More specifically, with two classes A and B, the cost of mis-classifying an instance that is actually an A as a B is different to the cost of mis-classifying an instance that is actually a B as an A.
For example, suppose you have a suspected life-threatening disease for which a particular expensive drug will probably save your life. The classes are (A) you actually have the disease, and (B) you don’t. What is the cost if the correct class is A but the doctor erroneously misclassifies you as B and therefore doesn’t prescribe the drug? Death! And what if the correct class is B but the doctor erroneously misclassifies you as A and therefore does prescribe the drug? Unnecessary expenditure. These are different costs!
We invite you to come up with other data mining/machine learning scenarios that have different error costs. But don’t stick to medicine … choose a different application area.
Or, if you like, try instead to come up with a real-life application scenario where the error costs are the same!
