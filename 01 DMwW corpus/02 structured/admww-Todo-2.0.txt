Incremental classifiers in Weka
Weka contains some classifiers that operate incrementally rather than in batch mode, like the Hoeffding Tree method for decision trees. Incremental classifiers don’t have to store the training data in memory.

Weka's MOA package 
Weka’s MOA package gives access to classification algorithms from the MOA system, which can deal with huge datasets and handle evolving data streams where the concept drifts over time.

The MOA interface 
The MOA system, a sister of Weka, operates fully incrementally, on data streams. Different evaluation methods are needed for stream data.

Dealing with change
An adaptive sliding window algorithm can detect change and update statistics from a data stream. The Hoeffding adaptive tree constructs “alternative branches” to prepare for changes. Bagging can be adapted for stream data.

Classifying tweets 
Twitter is BIG data! One application is sentiment analysis: does a tweet convey a positive or negative feelings? The Kappa statistic is often a more robust and useful measure than percent accuracy.

Signal peptide prediction 
What are important problems in bioinformatics? Signal peptide prediction is one. 
How can features be created from raw DNA sequence data?
And how can we evaluate the results?
