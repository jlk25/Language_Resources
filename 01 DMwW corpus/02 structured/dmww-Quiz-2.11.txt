Realistic performance estimates
Question 1
Select Percentage split as test option and set percentage for training to 80%. How many instances will be used for training, and how many for testing?
614 and 154.
615 and 153.
691 and 77.
1211 and 289 for training and testing respectively.
---
Correct answer(s):
---
Feedback correct:
The diabetes dataset has 768 instances, and an 80 : 20 split gives 614.4 : 153.6. Weka doesn’t truncate, it rounds to the nearest integer.
---
Feedback incorrect:
Don’t forget to set the percentage for training to 80%, not 90%.
---
Feedback incorrect:
Don’t forget to open the diabetes dataset, not the segment-challenge dataset.

Question 2
Select the J48 classifier (default options) and evaluate it with the following seed values (More options):
1,  2,  3,  4,  5
What are the minimum and maximum values for the number of incorrectly classified instances?
20 and 29.
31 and 44.
71 and 80.
110 and 123.
---
Correct answer(s):
---
Feedback correct:
The number of incorrect instances for the five seed values are 37, 35, 38, 31 and 44.
---
Feedback incorrect:
Don’t forget to look at the number of incorrectly classified instances, not the percentage.
---
Feedback incorrect:
Don’t forget to look at the number of incorrectly classified instances.

Question 3
What is the mean of the accuracy for these five seed values?
63.3%
75.3%
76.0%
95.0%
---
Correct answer(s):
---
Feedback correct:
The random seeds generate the following accuracies: 76.0, 77.3, 75.3, 79.9, 71.4. These have a mean of 76.0%.
---
Feedback incorrect:
Did you try divide the total by 6? (You should divide it by 5)
---
Feedback incorrect:
Did you try divide the total by 4? (You should divide it by 5)

Question 4
What is the standard deviation of the accuracy for these five seed values?
2.1
2.8
3.1
3.3
---
Correct answer(s):
---
Feedback correct:
The random seeds generate the following accuracies: 76.0, 77.3, 75.3, 79.9, 71.4. These have a standard deviation of 3.1.  Don’t forget to divide by 4 and not by 5; otherwise you will get a slightly smaller figure (2.8).
---
Feedback incorrect:
Don’t forget to divide by 4 and not by 5.

Question 5
If you did the experiment of Q.2 with 10 different random seeds rather than 5, how would you expect this to affect the mean and standard deviation?
They would both stay about the same.
The mean would be a bit bigger but the standard deviation would be about the same.
The mean would be about the same and the standard deviation would be a little smaller.
Both the mean and standard deviation would be a bit smaller.
---
Correct answer(s):
---
Feedback correct:
The estimated mean converges to the true mean, and the estimated standard deviation converges to the true standard deviation.
---
Feedback correct:
Correct! The estimated mean converges to the true mean, and the estimated standard deviation converges to the true standard deviation. However, the n – 1 factor in the denominator of the variance formula means that the standard deviation should decrease, although the effect is very small.
