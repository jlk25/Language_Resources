What's all this about cheating?
Confession time!
I called it “cheating” mainly to get your attention.
Here we’re talking about attribute selection, but the same phenomenon occurred back in Week 2 when we talked about supervised discretization. With supervised discretization you mustn’t use the test set to help determine discretization boundaries; with attribute selection you mustn’t use it to decide which attributes to select. If you do, I’ve called that “cheating”.
The dictionary definition of cheating is “acting dishonestly or unfairly in order to gain an advantage, especially in a game or examination”.
Is using the test set to help set discretization boundaries or select attributes really “cheating”? What do you think? What’s the real danger?
