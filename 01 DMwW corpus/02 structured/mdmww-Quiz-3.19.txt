Comparing clusterers using classification-by-clustering
Question 1
Are there any significant differences (at the default 5% level) between SimpleKMeans and EM?
Yes
No
---
Correct answer(s):
No
---
Feedback correct:
No v’s or *’s appear in the Experimenter output when you perform the default test on the result of this experiment

Question 2
For which datasets does SimpleKMeans outperform EM?
Select all the answers you think are correct.
breast-cancer
credit-g
diabetes
ionosphere
schizo

Correct answer(s):
breast-cancer
diabetes
schizo

Question 3
Of these datasets, XMeans can only process diabetes and ionosphere, because these are the only ones whose attributes are all numeric. Delete the other 4 datasets and add XMeans to the comparison, again constraining the number of clusters to 2.
Are there any significant differences (at the default 5% level) between XMeans and the other two clusterers?
Yes
No
