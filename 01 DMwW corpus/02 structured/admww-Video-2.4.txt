Weka's MOA package 
MOA is open source software that is specifically designed for mining data streams. It can handle evolving data streams – ones generated by mechanisms that change, or drift, over time. Like Weka, it contains many data mining methods. Weka’s MOA package gives access to these methods through the Weka Explorer. By the way, the moa was a huge flightless bird that lived in New Zealand until about 500 years ago.
