What classifiers do
Question 1
Works well and produces comprehensible models.
IBk
J48
LinearRegression
Logistic (Logistic regression)
NaiveBayes
OneR
SMO (Support vector machines)
ZeroR
---
Correct answer(s):
J48
---
Feedback correct:
The J48 classifier performs quite well, and provides the user with decision trees, which are easily understandable models.

Question 2
Works well when attributes contribute equally and independently to the decision.
IBk
J48
LinearRegression
Logistic (Logistic regression)
NaiveBayes
OneR
SMO (Support vector machine)
ZeroR
---
Correct answer(s):
NaiveBayes
---
Feedback correct:
The NaiveBayes classifier generally works well on datasets for which the independence assumption holds true.

Question 3
Simply stores the training data without processing it at all.
IBk
J48
LinearRegression
Logistic (Logistic regression)
NaiveBayes
OneR
SMO (Support vector machine)
ZeroR
---
Correct answer(s):
IBk
---
Feedback correct:
The nearest neighbor method IBk simply stores the training data. Although this overfits the training data, it can nevertheless work surprisingly well.

Question 4
Calculates a single linear decision boundary and outputs class probability estimates.
IBk
J48
LinearRegression
Logistic (Logistic regression)
NaiveBayes
OneR
SMO (Support vector machine)
ZeroR
---
Correct answer(s):
Logistic (Logistic regression)
---
Feedback correct:
The Logistic (Logistic regression) classifier calculates a linear decision boundary. (The boundaries obtained by IBk and SMO are piecewise linear.)

Question 5
Avoids overfitting, even with large numbers of attributes.
IBk
J48
LinearRegression
Logistic (Logistic regression)
NaiveBayes
OneR
SMO (Support vector machine)
ZeroR
---
Correct answer(s):
SMO (Support vector machine)
---
Feedback correct:
Through its use of a small number of support vectors, SMO (Support vector machine)  avoids overfitting even with large numbers of attributes.

Question 6
Determines the baseline performance for a dataset.
IBk
J48
LinearRegression
Logistic (Logistic regression)
NaiveBayes
OneR
SMO (Support vector machine)
ZeroR

Correct answer(s):

Question 6
Determines the baseline performance for a dataset.
IBk
J48
LinearRegression
Logistic (Logistic regression)
NaiveBayes
OneR
SMO (Support vector machine)
ZeroR
---
Correct answer(s):
ZeroR
---
Feedback correct:
By simply predicting the majority class, ZeroR provides a baseline performance measure for any dataset. OneR provides a slightly more sophisticated baseline.
---
Feedback correct:
By choosing to branch on a single attribute, OneR provides a baseline performance measure for any dataset. ZeroR provides a more rudimentary baseline.
