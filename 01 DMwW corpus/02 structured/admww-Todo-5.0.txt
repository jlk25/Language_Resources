Scripting Weka 
How can you script Weka?
This week's Big Question!
5.1
How can you script Weka?
article
Invoking Python from Weka 
Scripting allows automation, and reproducible experiments. There's a Weka package that opens an editor in which you can write and execute Python; we show a script for loading and filtering data.

Building models 
We write a Python script to build a J48 classifier for the "anneal" dataset, and add code to evaluate it using 10-fold cross-validation. We also build a J48 model and make predictions for an unlabeled test set.

Visualization 
Using the open source library JfreeChart. We create four visualizations with Weka: classifier errors (with error sizes); multiple ROC curves; a J48 decision tree; and a BayesNet network graph.

Invoking Weka from Python 
Now we bring Weka to the Python universe. Setting Python up on Linux is easy. But on Windows and OS X it’s not for the faint-hearted! We use the python-weka-wrapper library to replicate scripts from previous lessons.

A data mining challenge, and some Groovy 
Put your knowledge to use by applying it to real-world data! Groovy is an alternative scripting language to Python; we use it to replicate some Python scripts.
