Building models
Peter demonstrates writing three Python scripts for Weka using the J48 classifier, using the anneal dataset. The first builds a classifier and outputs the model, the second evaluates a classifier and outputs summary statistics and a confusion matrix, and the third builds a classifier and makes predictions on an unlabeled dataset.
