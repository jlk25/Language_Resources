Challenges for machine learning applications
At the beginning of the last video Geoff introduced six challenges for machine learning applications:
  A law passed or legal decision made that relies on the result of an ML analysis
  $100M saved through improved decision making provided by an ML system
  A conflict between nations averted through high-quality translation provided by an ML system
  A 50% reduction in cybersecurity break-ins through ML defences
  A human life saved through a diagnosis or intervention recommended by an ML system
  Improvement of 10% in one countryâ€™s Human Development Index (HDI).
What do you think of these? Can you come up with other important challenges?
