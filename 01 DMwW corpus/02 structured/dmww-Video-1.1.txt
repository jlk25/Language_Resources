What's data mining? What's Weka?
Everybody talks about data mining and “big data” nowadays. Example applications range from analyzing the contents of your supermarket basket in order to entice you to spend more in your next shopping expedition, to helping a couple conceive a baby by enhancing the chance of successful artificial insemination. Weka is a powerful yet easy-to-use tool for machine learning and data mining that you will soon download and experiment with. During this course you will learn how to load data, filter it to clean it up, explore it using visualizations, apply classification algorithms, interpret the output, and evaluate the result. You will also learn that New Zealand is at the top of the world, and you may be at the bottom!
