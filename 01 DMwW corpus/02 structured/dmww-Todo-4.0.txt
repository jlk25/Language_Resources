Classification boundaries 
Different classifiers are biased towards different kinds of decision, which you can explore by visualizing the classification boundaries. We look at classification boundaries for OneR, IBk, NaiveBayes, and J48.

Linear regression
"Regression" problems are where the class is numeric, and "linear regression" is a standard mathematical technique for predicting numeric classes. In addition, there are non-linear methods that build trees of linear models.

Classification by regression
Linear regression can be used for classification as well. For two-valued nominal classes, just convert them to 0 and 1. For more class labels, either "multi-response linear regression" or "pairwise linear regression" can be used.

Logistic regression
Sometimes it’s best to predict class probabilities instead of predicting the classes themselves. Linear regression can be made to work with probabilities, resulting in logistic regression, a popular classification technique.

Yikes! The math! It’s too much!

Support vector machines
Support vector machines separate the classes using the "maximum margin hyperplane." This is defined by a few instances, called "support vectors," from each class. The boundary depends on a few points, which reduces overfitting.

Ensemble learning
Many of us dislike committees, but nevertheless they often make good, unbiased, decisions. Several machine learning methods use "committees" of different classifier algorithms: Bagging, Random forests, Boosting, and Stacking.
