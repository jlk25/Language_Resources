Outliers
Question 1
View the data in Weka’s Visualize panel. What does it look like?
(a)
(b)
(c)
---
Correct answer(s):
(c)
---
Feedback correct:
This data plots phone calls against year. In the 1960s it exhibits a large, surprising, sustained, spike.

Question 2
The class (phone calls) is numeric, so LinearRegression seems appropriate. Try it. What is the correlation coefficient, when evaluated with 10-fold cross-validation?
0.45
0.54
0.95
0.99
1.00
---
Correct answer(s):
0.45
---
Feedback incorrect:
That’s what you get when you evaluate it on the training set.

Question 3
In order to visualize the result, add the classifier’s predictions to the dataset using the supervised attribute filter AddClassification, and go to the Visualize panel. (As you will discover, this filter does nothing unless you turn on the outputClassification option.) What does the plot look like?
(a)
(b)
(c)
---
Correct answer(s):
(b)
---
Feedback correct:
Linear regression fits a straight line to the data, which in this case is increasing. But it’s not a very good fit. Imagine the regression line superimposed on the plot of phone calls against year. (Unfortunately you will have to imagine it, because Weka’s built-in visualization facilities do not allow two graphs to be plotted at once.)

Question 4
Run LinearRegression in the Classify panel. Make sure you are predicting the right thing (phone calls, not classification)!
What is the model that is produced?
---
Correct answer(s):
0.5041
26.0059

Question 5
First, use Weka’s Package Manager to install the leastMedSquared package.
Now change the classifier to LeastMedSq, another regression-style classifier. Run it in the Classify panel.
Which of these models does it produce (numbers have been rounded)?
0.5 * year – 26
0.1 * year – 5
0.05 * year + 0.1 * classification – 2
---
Correct answer(s):
0.1 * year – 5
---
Feedback correct:
This is a straight line with slope 0.1, which is much less than the 0.5 generated by LinearRegression (first answer above)
---
Feedback incorrect:
That’s the model produced by LinearRegression
---
Feedback incorrect:
classification is not an attribute of the original dataset! Remove it before applying LeastMedSq.

Question 6
Do the LinearRegression and LeastMedSq methods yield similar regression lines?
yes
no
---
Correct answer(s):
no
---
Feedback correct:
LeastMedSq gives a line with slope 0.11, whereas LinearRegression gives a slope of 0.5. To see the difference graphically, sketch them on a piece of paper, and imagine them superimposed on the plot of phone calls against year, as you did earlier for LinearRegression.
---
Feedback incorrect:
They should be very different. Be sure that you are using the correct attribute, phone calls, as the class.

Question 7
LeastMedSq gives an accurate regression line even when there are outliers. However, it is computationally very expensive. In practical situations it is common to delete outliers manually and then use linear regression. Identify the outliers using the Visualize panel and remove them manually (there are six obvious ones, plus two more that are not quite so striking). Apply LinearRegression again. What is the correlation coefficient, when evaluated with 10-fold cross-validation?
0.45
0.88
0.98
0.99
1.00
---
Correct answer(s):
0.99
---
Feedback correct:
The correlation of the predictions with the data has improved enormously, from 0.45 to 0.99 – near-perfect correlation.
---
Feedback incorrect:
This (0.4452) is the result you get for the full data set
---
Feedback incorrect:
This (0.8759) is the result when you delete the 6 most obvious outliers. Delete a further 2, one on either side of that range.
---
Feedback incorrect:
This (0.9803) is the result when you delete the 6 most obvious outliers plus one more. You need to identify and delete a further outlier.

Question 8
There’s something fishy about this data. Do an internet search for “International Phone Calls from Belgium 1950-1973” and find out what went wrong with the dataset. What is the reason for the outliers?
Human error
Different measurement used
Flat rate for calls introduced
---
Correct answer(s):

Correct answer(s):
Different measurement used
---
Feedback correct:
Instead of the number of phone calls, between 1964 and 1970 the total duration of the calls (in minutes) was recorded. Such errors are quite common in practice.
