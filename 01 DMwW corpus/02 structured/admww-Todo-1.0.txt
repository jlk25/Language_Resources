Time series: linear regression with lags 
The simplest kind of forecasting is linear regression, "Date" attributes must be normalized in order to interpret the linear model. Linear predictions can be improved by adding lagged copies of variables.

Using the time series forecasting package 
The time series forecasting package automatically produces lots of lagged variables
... and lots of other variables too, which can lead to overfitting. Beware of evaluation based on training data: simpler models can be better!
