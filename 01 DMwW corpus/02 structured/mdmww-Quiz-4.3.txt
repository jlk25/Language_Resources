Using a wrapper to select attributes
Question 1
What would the final attribute subset contain if you used ZeroR with forward search?
Nothing
Na
Si
K
All attributes
---
Correct answer(s):
Nothing
---
Feedback correct:
All attribute subsets yield the same performance, and the preference is for the smallest subset, so the result is a set with no attributes (the “empty” set)

Question 2
What would the final attribute subset contain if you used ZeroR with backward search?
Nothing
RI
Fe
Al
All attributes
---
Correct answer(s):
Nothing
---
Feedback correct:
Same as for the previous question. In this case the order of searching is irrelevant.

Question 3
For this question and the next you need to know that OneR chooses Al as the attribute for this dataset.
What would the final attribute subset contain if you used OneR with forward search?
Nothing
Al
All attributes
---
Correct answer(s):
Al
---
Feedback correct:
OneR chooses Al for this dataset, and exactly the same result would be obtained for any larger subset of attributes. So preferring the smallest subset leads to the 1-attribute subset containing Al alone.

Question 4
What would final attribute subset contain if you used OneR with backward search?
None
Al
All attributes
---
Correct answer(s):
Al
---
Feedback correct:
OneR chooses Al for this dataset, and any subset of attributes that does not include Al will yield a worse result. Again, the subset containing Al alone is preferred over larger subsets that also contain Al.

Question 5
Use Weka to confirm your intuition for the above questions.
Now use the Classify panel to run IBk (with default parameters) on the glass.arff dataset, evaluating using 10-fold cross-validation. What is the percentage of correctly classified instances?
71%
72%
75%
78%
80%
---
Correct answer(s):
71%

Question 6
What is the percentage of correctly classified instances when the attribute set is {RI, Na, Mg, Ca, Ba}?
(This is the set that Ian found at the beginning of the video Wrapper attribute selection, using wrapper-based attribute selection with J48 in the wrapper.)
72%
74%
76%
78%
80%

Correct answer(s):
78%

Correct answer(s):

Question 7
Use the Select attributes panel to find the subset selected by WrapperSubsetEval using IBk and BestFirst search (default parameters throughout). There are 6 attributes in this subset. What are they? (Type them in order.)
---
Correct answer(s):
RI
Mg
Al
K
Ca
Ba

Question 8
What percentage of correctly classified instances does IBk yield for that attribute set?
71%
72%
75%
78%
80%
---
Correct answer(s):
78%

Question 9
For this question you will first need to install Weka’s attributeSelectionSearchMethods package. (That’s a nuisance? – hey, it only takes about 2 minutes!)
Restore the original dataset and choose the “Exhaustive search” search method on the Select attributes panel. This searches all 512 possible subsets of the 9 attributes.
What attribute subset is selected by WrapperSubsetEval using IBk (default parameters)?
---
Correct answer(s):
RI
Na
Mg
K
Ca
Ba

Question 10
What percentage of correctly classified instances does IBk yield for that attribute set?
71%
73%
75%
77%
79%
---
Correct answer(s):
79%
