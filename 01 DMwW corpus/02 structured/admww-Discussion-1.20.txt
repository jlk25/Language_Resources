Reflect on this week’s Big Question
This week’s Big Question is, “How can you use data mining to foretell the future?”
We promised that by the end you’d be able to explain the role of “lagged variables” in time-series analysis. You’d be experienced in the use of Weka’s time series forecasting package, and be able to work with data that varies on an hourly, daily, weekly, monthly, and yearly basis. You’d understand that the standard holdout and cross-validation methods simply do not work for time series, and know what to do about it. And you’d be able to explain what “overlay data” is and how valuable it can be. Oh yes, and you’ll have even more experience of that perennial problem of overfitting, and how to detect it.
Well, what do you think now? Time series forecasting is foretelling the future, though admittedly in a rather limited sense. Though we have used the standard prediction methods of linear regression and SMO, time series require different attributes and different evaluation methods. Cross-validation is no longer useful. Continued extrapolation is, but its accuracy deteriorates as the forecasting period increases.
