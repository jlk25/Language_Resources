Question 5
In 2006, a text file was released on the web containing 20,000,000 search engine queries made by 650,000 users over a 3-month period, intended for research purposes. The file had been anonymized by replacing user names with random numbers, one per user. However, some of the queries contained clues to the user’s identity. The New York Times was able to locate an individual from these supposedly anonymized search records by cross referencing them with phonebook listings. Look up this classic example of reidentification and read about it.
