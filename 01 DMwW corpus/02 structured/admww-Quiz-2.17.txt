Mid-course assessment 
Question 1
Restart the Weka Explorer (to reset the Forecast parameters to default values) and open the appleStocks2011.arff dataset. What is the first date covered by the dataset (in the form yyyy-mm-dd)?
---
Correct answer(s):

Question 2
With this dataset, go to the Forecast panel. Why is the Start button not activated?
Weka doesn’t know which attribute to predict
Weka doesn’t know which field contains the time stamp
Weka can’t detect the periodicity of the data
No classifier is specified
---
Correct answer(s):
Weka doesn’t know which attribute to predict

Question 3
Specify Daily periodicity, and predict any attribute.
In the Output panel you will see that several training instances had missing values imputed via interpolation. What is the instance number of the first and last such instance?
---
Correct answer(s):

Question 4
Most of these missing-value instances correspond to weekends. Remove these by putting an appropriate specification into the Skip list, and re-run.
What is the instance number of the first and last missing-value instance now?
---
Correct answer(s):

Question 5
Ignore all missing instances by entering this into the Skip list:
weekend,2011-01-17@yyyy-MM-dd,2011-02-21,2011-04-22,2011-05-30,2011-07-04
Predict the attribute “High” (only). Remove leading instances with missing values (under Lag creation, More Options). Evaluate on the training data and on 10 days of held-out data.
The mean absolute error on the training data is 3.1. What is it on the test data?
3.1
3.3
4.1
6.6
6.7
7.9
---
Correct answer(s):
6.7

Question 6
Configure the Lag creation panel by setting the minimum and maximum lags both to 1, and by removing powers of time and products of time and lagged variables (under More options).
When you activate Start you will get a model that involves 2 attributes.
Reconfigure the Periodic attributes to get a model that involves a single attribute – a lag attribute.
What is the model?
---
Correct answer(s):

Question 7
Use the dataset of soil samples org_c_n.arff to predict organic nitrogen (rather than organic carbon, as was done in the Analyzing infrared data from soil samples video).
Load the dataset. Remove unnecessary attributes, and remove instances with a missing value for the class.
How many attributes and instances are left?
Select all the answers you think are correct.
217 attributes (including the class)
220 attributes (including the class)
1555 instances
2884 instances
3911 instances
4439 instances
---
Correct answer(s):
217 attributes (including the class)
2884 instances

Question 8
A standard classifier used in the soil analysis industry is the Partial Least Squares classifier, called PLSClassifier in Weka.
It’s not in the standard distribution, but in a package called partialLeastSquares. Install this into your Weka system.
What correlation coefficient does PLSClassifier achieve when predicting organic nitrogen from the dataset you prepared in the previous question (default parameters, evaluated using 10-fold cross-validation)?
0.0731
0.1976
0.1978
0.4229
0.4239
0.4249
---
Correct answer(s):
0.4249

Question 9
Open the elecNormNew.arff dataset in the Weka Explorer and evaluate, the performance of these classifiers (using 10-fold cross-validation):
    A: Weka’s Hoeffding tree
    B: MOA’s Hoeffding tree
    C: MOA’s Hoeffding Option Tree
    D: MOA’s Hoeffding Adaptive Tree
(To access the last three, you will need to have installed Weka’s massiveOnlineAnalysis package.)
How does their performance compare, in terms of correctly classified instances?
A < C < D < B
B < A < D < C
B < D < A < C
C < A < D < B
D < C < B < A
---
Correct answer(s):
B < D < A < C

Question 10
Use MOA to determine the accuracy of HoeffdingTree on a WaveformGenerator stream of 1,000,000 instances, with Prequential evaluation and the BasicClassificationPerformanceEvaluator.
What is the final current accuracy? (Note: current accuracy, not mean accuracy.)
75.71%
75.84%
75.85%
82.98%
83.80%
83.89%
