Exploring Weka's interfaces, and working with big data
Hello again
This practical course on more advanced data mining follows on from Data Mining with Weka. You'll become an expert Weka user, and pick up many new techniques and principles of data mining along the way.

What are Weka's other interfaces for?
Each week we’ll focus on a couple of “Big Questions” relating to data mining. This is the first Big Question for this week.

Exploring the Experimenter 
You can use the Experimenter to find the performance of classification algorithms on datasets, or to determine whether one classifier performs better (or runs faster) than another. In the Explorer, such things can be tedious.

Comparing classifiers
The Experimenter can be used to compare classifiers. The "null hypothesis" is that they perform the same. To show that one is better than the other, we must *reject* this hypothesis at a given level of statistical significance.

The Knowledge Flow interface 
The Knowledge Flow interface is an alternative to the Explorer. You can lay out filters, classifiers, evaluators on a 2D canvas ... and connect them up in different ways. Data and classification models flow through the diagram!

Using the Command Line
You can do everything the Explorer does (and more) from the command line.
One advantage is that you get more control over memory usage.
To access the definitive source of Weka documentation you need to learn to use JavaDoc.

Working with big data 
The Explorer can handle pretty big datasets, but it has limits. However, the Command Line Interface does not: it works incrementally whenever it can. Some classifiers can handle arbitrarily large datasets.
