Cross-validation results
Cross-validation is better than randomly repeating percentage split evaluations. The reason is that each instance occurs exactly once in a test set, and is tested just once. Repeated random splits are liable to produce less reliable results: the average will be about the same but the variance is higher. This is confirmed with an experiment on the diabetes dataset: 10 repeated percentage splits yield a variance of 4.6%, as opposed to 0.9% with 10-fold cross-validation. Why 10-fold? Good question! It seems to be a reasonable compromise.
