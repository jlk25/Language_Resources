Naive Bayes with dependent attributes
Question 1
What is NaiveBayes’s accuracy on this dataset?
79%
84%
90%
91%
---
Correct answer(s):
90%
---
Feedback correct:
(Weka gives the result as 90.1149%.)
---
Feedback incorrect:
Are you using the default options and 10-fold cross validation as the evaluation method?

Question 2
Return to the Preprocess tab and copy the 12th attribute, education-spending, ten times, using the Copy filter.
(You will run into a problem that is easily solved with a little ingenuity. And don’t forget that the word last can be used as an attribute index.)
What is NaiveBayes’s accuracy on this new dataset, again evaluated using 10-fold cross-validation?
86%
87%
90%
91%
---
Correct answer(s):
87%
---
Feedback correct:
(Weka gives the result as 86.6667%)
---
Feedback incorrect:
There should be 27 attributes in the dataset

Question 3
Return to the Preprocess tab and copy the same attribute a further ten times. What is the accuracy now?
86%
87%
90%
91%
---
Correct answer(s):
86%
---
Feedback correct:
(Weka gives the result as 86.4368%)
---
Feedback incorrect:
There should be 37 attributes in the dataset

Question 4
You’re probably thinking that if you were to continue to make copies of the education-spending attribute and evaluate by 10-fold cross-validation, the accuracy would gradually decrease until it finally leveled off. And you’d be right! What percentage accuracy does it level off at?
84%
85%
86%
87%
---
Correct answer(s):
84%
---
Feedback correct:
Do not make more copies of this attribute. Use what you know about Naive Bayes to figure out a better, quicker, and more reliable way.
(To be precise, 84.1379%.)
Continuing to make copies of an attribute gives it an increasingly stronger contribution to the decision, until – in the extreme – the other attributes have no influence at all. You can determine this value by removing all attributes except education-spending (but leave the class, of course).

Feedback incorrect:
Do not make more copies of this attribute. Use what you know about Naive Bayes to figure out a better, quicker, and more reliable way.

Question 5
If Naive Bayes’s accuracy continually deteriorates as you add copies of a particular attribute (as it does here for education-spending), do you think it would improve if that attribute was completely removed from the dataset?
Yes
No
Maybe

Feedback correct:
It might. (In the present case, accuracy drops a little when education-spending is removed, so it seems that this attribute is slightly relevant to the class.)
