Reflect on this week's Big Questions 
The Big Questions this week are, “How can you discretize numeric attributes?” and “How do you classify documents?”
We promised that by the end you’d be able to explain various discretization strategies, and how to discretize in a way that preserves the ordering information inherent in numeric attributes, and why pre-discretization might be better than building the same discretization method into a classifier—and why it might work the other way around! Perhaps the most important skill is how to fairly evaluate a classification method that involves supervised filters (using the FilteredClassifier).
We also promised that you’d be able to use Weka to classify documents, and use threshold curves to show different tradeoffs between error types.
Well, can you explain these things to a colleague? The most challenging ones are:
  how to preserve ordering information in nominal attributes;
  why it’s non-trivial to evaluate a classification method that involves supervised filters;
  threshold curves.
So: choose one, explain it, and tell your fellow learners how you got on.
