0.51
0.69
0.90
0.91
---
Correct answer(s):
0.69

Question 2
What is the weighted-average ROC Area for Naive Bayes?
0.90
0.95
0.96
0.98
---
Correct answer(s):
0.96

Question 3
What is the weighted-average ROC Area for NaiveBayes with nominal attributes? (Hint: use the NumericToNominal filter as well as the StringToWordVector filter, and combine them with the MultiFilter.)
0.89
0.92
0.93
0.96
---
Correct answer(s):
0.89

Question 4
Judging by the ROC Area, which of these three methods perform best?
J48
NaiveBayes with nominal attributes
NaiveBayes with numeric attributes
---
Correct answer(s):
NaiveBayes with numeric attributes
---
Feedback correct:
This method produces a weighted-average ROC area of 0.962, significantly better than J48, and better than NaiveBayes using nominal attributes (which is perhaps a little surprising).

Question 5
Examine the ROC curve for J48, which you obtain by right-clicking its line in the Result list and selecting “Visualize threshold curve” for 0.
Which part of the graph corresponds to more than 75% accuracy for the second class?
The leftmost 25% of the horizontal axis.
The rightmost 25% of the horizontal axis.
The upper 25% of the vertical axis.
---
Correct answer(s):
The leftmost 25% of the horizontal axis.
---
Feedback correct:
The horizontal (X) axis plots the False Positive (FP) rate, which is
1 – accuracy of the second class, 
so the region from 0 to 0.25 corresponds to more than 75% accuracy for the second class.
---
Feedback incorrect:
The horizontal (X) axis plots the False Positive (FP) rate, which is
1 – accuracy of the second class
---
Feedback incorrect:
The error rate for the second class is plotted on the horizontal axis.

Question 6
Which of these statements regarding this ROC curve do you agree with?
An accuracy of 75% for the second class can be combined with with an accuracy of 75% for the first class.
An accuracy of more than 75% for the second class can only be achieved with an accuracy of less than 5% for the first class.
An accuracy of 75% for the second class can be combined with an accuracy of 25% for the first class.
---
Correct answer(s):
An accuracy of more than 75% for the second class can only be achieved with an accuracy of less than 5% for the first class.

Question 7
Examine the corresponding ROC curve for NaiveBayes with numeric attributes (i.e., the default configuration).
Which part of the graph corresponds to more than 80% accuracy for the first class?
The rightmost 20% of the horizontal axis.
The lower 20% of the vertical axis.
The upper 20% of the vertical axis.
---
Correct answer(s):
The upper 20% of the vertical axis.
---
Feedback correct:
The vertical (Y) axis plots the True Positive (TP) rate, which is the same as the accuracy for the first class.

Question 8
Which of these statements regarding this ROC curve do you agree with?
An accuracy of more than 90% for the first class can be combined with an accuracy of more than 90% on the second class.
An accuracy of more than 75% for the first class can be combined with an accuracy of more than 95% for the second class.
An accuracy of more than 95% for the first class can be combined with an accuracy of more than 80% for the second class.
---
Correct answer(s):
An accuracy of more than 75% for the first class can be combined with an accuracy of more than 95% for the second class.
