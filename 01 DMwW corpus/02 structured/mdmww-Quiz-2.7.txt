ionosphere
iris
schizo
(none)
---
Correct answer(s):
schizo

Question 5

diabetes
glass
ionosphere
iris
schizo
(none)
---
Correct answer(s):
(none)

Question 6
For which dataset (if any) does PART’s built-in discretization gives significantly better results than the Filtered Classifer?
diabetes
glass
ionosphere
iris
schizo
(none)
---
Correct answer(s):
(none)

Question 7
For which dataset (if any) does PART’s built-in discretization gives significantly worse results than the Filtered Classifer?
diabetes

Question 8
The classifiers SMO and SimpleLogistic implement linear decision boundaries in instance space.
How would you expect pre-discretization (with makeBinary enabled) to affect their performance?
Make it worse than without discretization.
Make it better than without discretization.
---
Correct answer(s):
Make it better than without discretization.
---
Feedback correct:
Discretization (with makeBinary enabled) would probably improve performance, because it allows a more complex model, one that is no longer linear in the decision space.

(none)
---
Correct answer(s):
(none)

Question 13
IBk can implement arbitrary boundaries in instance space.
How would you expect pre-discretization to affect IBk’s performance?
Pre-discretization would improve its performance

Pre-discretization would not change its performance significantly
---
Correct answer(s):
Pre-discretization would not change its performance significantly
---
Feedback incorrect:
Although it may do so at times, this is probably coincidental.
