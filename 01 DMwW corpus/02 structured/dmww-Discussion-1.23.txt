Reflect on this week's Big Question
The Big Question this week is, “What’s it like to do data mining?”
We said that by the end you would be able to demonstrate the use of Weka for the key tasks of examining a dataset, classifying it with a decision tree, filtering it with various filters, and visualizing the dataset and the result of learning.
So: can you?
And how about explaining (to your partner, siblings, parents or kids) … what it’s like to do data mining?
Tell your fellow learners how you get on!
