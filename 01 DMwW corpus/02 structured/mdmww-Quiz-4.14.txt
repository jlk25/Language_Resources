Cost-sensitive classification
Question 1
In the Explorer, load breast-cancer.arff and apply Naive Bayes (evaluate using 10-fold cross-validation throughout this Quiz). How many recurrence-events are misclassified as no-recurrence-events?
33
37
48
168
---
Correct answer(s):
48

Question 2
Assume that misclassifying a recurrence-event as a no-recurrence-event (and therefore terminating treatment prematurely) is twice as costly as the reverse (and therefore continuing treatment unnecessarily).
Check Cost-sensitive evaluation in the More options menu and specify a cost matrix that reflects this asymmetry in misclassification costs by doubling the cost of one error type.
Apply Naive Bayes again, and check that the evaluation cost matrix appears near the beginning of the output. What is output as the “total cost”?
81
114
129

Correct answer(s):
129
---
Feedback correct:
129 is 2x48 + 1x33
---
Feedback incorrect:
Perhaps you put “2” in the upper right-hand corner of the cost matrix? That is not the correct place.

Question 3
Now apply the CostSensitiveClassifier metalearner with Naive Bayes, defining the cost matrix appropriately (but leaving the other parameters at their default values).
How many recurrence-events are misclassified as no-recurrence-events now?

Correct answer(s):
36

Question 4
What is output as the “total cost”?
90
126
144
180
---
Correct answer(s):
126
---
Feedback correct:
126 is 2x36 + 1x54
Using cost-sensitive classification the cost decreases (from 129 without cost-sensitive classification to 126 with cost-sensitive classification) even though the total number of errors has increased (from 81 to 90 incorrectly classified instances).
The reason is that the number of critical misclassifications – the more costly ones – has decreased (from 48 to 36).

Question 5
Repeat the whole procedure with J48 instead of Naive Bayes.
When you change from ordinary to cost-sensitive classification, does the total number of errors increase?
Yes
No
---
Correct answer(s):
Yes
---
Feedback correct:
It increases from 70 (which is 62+8) to 96 (which is 55+41) incorrectly classified instances

Question 6
Using cost-sensitive classification, is the number of critical misclassifications – the more costly ones – smaller with J48 than with Naive Bayes?
Yes
No
---
Correct answer(s):
No
---
Feedback correct:
For J48 there are 55 critical misclassifications, compared with 36 for Naive Bayes

Question 7
Again using cost-sensitive classification, is the total cost smaller with J48 than with Naive Bayes?
Yes
No
---
Correct answer(s):
No
---
Feedback correct:
For J48 the total cost is 151, compared with 126 for Naive Bayes.

Question 8
Still using J48, alter the cost matrix to treat misclassifying a recurrence-event as a no-recurrence-event as five times as costly as the reverse (instead of twice as costly as before), and repeat the experiment.
What is the total number of errors now?
24
121
141
165
---
Correct answer(s):
165
---
Feedback correct:
141 no-recurrence events are classified as recurrence-events, and 24 recurrence-events are classified as no-recurrence-events
---
Feedback incorrect:
24 recurrence-events are classified as no-recurrence-events, but the question asks for the total number of errors
---
Feedback incorrect:
141 no-recurrence events are classified as recurrence-events, but the question asks for the total number of errors

Question 9
What is the number of critical (i.e., more costly) misclassifications?
24
60
61
141
---
Correct answer(s):
24

Question 10
What is the total cost now?
(Note: you must specify the new cost matrix in the More options menu, as well as in the CostSensitiveClassifier.)
165
189
261
729
---
Correct answer(s):
261
---
Feedback correct:
261 is 5x24 + 1x141
---
Feedback incorrect:
189 is 2x24 + 1x141. Perhaps you didn’t change the evaluation cost matrix in the More options menu?

Question 11
Remember that old rule, always check your results against a baseline classifier? With this cost matrix, cost-sensitive classification with ZeroR does even better!
What is the total cost for ZeroR (with all the same settings)?

Feedback correct:
ZeroR classifies everything as a recurrence-event. With a multiplier of 5 for the cost of misclassifying a recurrence-event as a no-recurrence-event, this is a very good idea!
