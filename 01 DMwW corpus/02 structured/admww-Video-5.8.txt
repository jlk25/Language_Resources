Visualization
Peter shows how to create visualizations from Weka’s Jython console using the open source library JfreeChart. First he plots the errors made by LinearRegression on a dataset, indicating the size of each error by the radius of a bubble. Next he displays multiple ROC curves, one for each class in the dataset. Then he draws a tree generated by J48, and finally a graph generated by the BayesNet classifier.
