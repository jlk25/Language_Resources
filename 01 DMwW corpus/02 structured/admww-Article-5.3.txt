Do it yourself!
First install two packages using the Package Manager:
  the tigerjython package
  the jfreechartOffscreenRenderer package
Note: tigerjython is not yet compatible with Java 9. When you installed Weka, if you downloaded a self-extracting archive that included Java, it will have been Java 8; no problems. However, if you normally run Weka under Java 9 you will have to temporarily use Java 8.
Then create an environment variable called MOOC_DATA that points to your Weka data files folder:
  On Windows, Peter right-clicked on This PC and selected Properties to get the Control Panel, then Advanced system settings, then Environment Variables. Click New… and type in the variable name and value.
  On the Mac, you can install envPane in your Preferences, which makes it easy to set environment variables.
Here’s Peter’s script for loading and filtering data:
  load_and_filter_data.py
