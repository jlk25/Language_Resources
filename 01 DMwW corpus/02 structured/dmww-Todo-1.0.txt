A little bit of everything
What's data mining? What's Weka? What's the course about?
Everybody talks about data mining and "big data" nowadays. This course introduces you to practical data mining. Weka is a powerful yet easy to use tool for machine learning and data mining that can also tackle large problems.

Exploring datasets
Classification (also called "supervised learning") is a common kind of data mining problem. Datasets contain "instances," which are described in terms of a fixed set of features, or "attributes".

Building a classifier
Now you will learn how to use Weka's popular J48 classifier, which builds decision trees. J48 is a reimplementation of a classic classifier algorithm called C4.5.

Using a filter
WEKA contains "filters" that help with cleaning and preparing your data. Some filters operate on attributes; others operate on instances.

Visualizing your data
With Weka's visualization tool you can clean the data and remove anomalous instances (outliers). You can also visualize the errors that classifiers make.
