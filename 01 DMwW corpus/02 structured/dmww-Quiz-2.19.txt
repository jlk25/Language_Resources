Mid-course assessment
Question 1
Open the blood_fat_corrupted.arff dataset.
Note: this is not in your Weka installation; you must download it from the above link. Make sure you save it as blood_fat_corrupted.arff and not blood_fat_corrupted.arff.txt, otherwise Weka won’t see it.
How many instances are there? How many attributes? What are the possible class values?
Select all the answers you think are correct.
26 instances
27 instances
2 attributes
3 attributes
class values low, medium, very_high
class values low, medium, high, very_high
class values weight, age, blood_fat
---
Correct answer(s):
27 instances
3 attributes
class values low, medium, high, very_high

Question 2
The blood_fat_corrupted dataset contains two corrupted values. What instances and attributes do they occur in?

Correct answer(s):

Question 6
Determine the performance of ZeroR, NaiveBayes, IBk, and OneR on the soybean dataset, evaluated using a 90% split into training and test instances (with the default random number seed of 1). Which order do they come in?
---
Correct answer(s):

Question 7
Imagine a dataset with 150 instances and 3 class values. 25 of the instances belong to the first class, 50 to the second, and 75 to the third. What is the accuracy of ZeroR for this dataset, when evaluated on the training set?
25%
33%
50%
66%
75%
---
Correct answer(s):
50%

Question 8
For the dataset in the previous question (150 instances, of which 25, 50 and 75 belong to the three classes), would you expect exactly 50% accuracy if ZeroR were evaluated using (a) a 90% split into training and test instances, and (b) 10-fold cross-validation?
Select all the answers you think are correct.
(a) no
(a) yes
(b) no
(b) yes
---
Correct answer(s):
(a) no
(b) yes

Question 9
For the ionosphere.arff dataset, evaluate J48 five times using a 80% split into training and test instances, with the five random seeds 1, 4, 5, 6, and 8. What is the mean and standard deviation of the classification accuracy?
Select all the answers you think are correct.
mean is 86.0%
mean is 89.7%
standard deviation is 0.3%
standard deviation is 4.5%
standard deviation is 4.9%
standard deviation is 5.5%
---
Correct answer(s):
mean is 86.0%
standard deviation is 5.5%

useful.

Question 10
If J48 was evaluated on the ionosphere dataset using a single 5-fold cross-validation, would you expect the performance estimate to be more reliable or less reliable than the mean value obtained in Question 9?
about the same
less reliable
more reliable provided the cross-validation is stratified
more reliable regardless of whether or not the cross-validation is stratified
---
Correct answer(s):
more reliable regardless of whether or not the cross-validation is stratified
