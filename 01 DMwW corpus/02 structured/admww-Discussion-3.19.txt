Reflect on this week’s Big Questions
This week’s first Big Question is, “What’s in Weka’s LibSVM and LibLINEAR packages?”
We promised that by the end you’d be able to explain what they do, why you would use them, and how to use them.
And the second is, “How do you access R from Weka?”
We promised that by the end you’d be able to explain what R is, why it’s important, and what you can do with it. And, of course, how to access R from Weka.
The first question is easy. LibSVM and LibLINEAR are powerful implementations of support vector machines. LibSVM is very flexible; LibLINEAR is very fast. And now you can use them. But more importantly, you also learned some useful things about machine learning generally: the power of non-linear kernels, 1-class classification, and the L1 norm.
As for the second question, now you know what R is, and how to create and use Weka’s R Console. It’s a powerful statistical programming language, and we only looked at a tiny subset of what it can do: impressive facilities for plotting data through the ggplot2 package for R; how to use R’s numerous regression and classification schemes just as you would any other Weka classifier through the MLR classifier; and how to access R’s comprehensive data preprocessing facilities from Weka’s Knowledge Flow interface through the RScriptExecutor component.
