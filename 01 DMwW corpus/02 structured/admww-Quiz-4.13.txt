Playing with template flows
Question 1
Open the “Spark: run k-means parallel” template and run it.
What is the within-cluster sum of squared errors of the k-means model learned on the hypothyroid data, and how many iterations did k-means perform to generate it?
Select all the answers you think are correct.
Sum of squared errors: 56.7
Sum of squared errors: 3867.2
Sum of squared errors: 3867.3
Sum of squared errors: 4329.4
Number of iterations: 6
Number of iterations: 8
Number of iterations: 10
Number of iterations: 12
---
Correct answer(s):
Sum of squared errors: 3867.3
Number of iterations: 10

Question 2
k-means parallel uses a distributed version of the k-means++ initialization routine designed to give a better final solution than using random initialization.
Switch to random initialization in the KMeansClustererSparkJob by setting the initWithRandomCentroids property to True, and then run the flow again.
What is the within-cluster sum of squared errors now?
56.7
3867.2
3867.3
4329.4
---
Correct answer(s):
4329.4

Question 3
Is the k-means++ initialization really better than random initialization?
Try different seeds, using values 10, 50, 100 for the randomSeed property in the KMeansClustererSparkJob for both k-means++ initialization (initWithRandomCentroids = False) and random initialization (initWithRandomCentroids = True).
The best result using seed values 1, 10, 50 and 100 is given by …
k-means++
k-means with random initialization
---
Correct answer(s):
k-means++
---
Feedback correct:
The 3867.3 obtained above is the best of all 8 results obtained using the 4 seeds and 2 initialization methods

Question 4
How many of the top 4 of the 8 results in the previous question are obtained by k-means++ initialization?
0
1

Correct answer(s):
3

Question 5
Open the “Spark: compute a correlation matrix and run PCA” template and run it.
Right-click on the ImageViewer and select Show images.
What is the largest off-diagonal correlation in the matrix?
0.25
0.29
0.31
0.52
0.65
---
Correct answer(s):
0.52

Question 6
Open the TextViewer to see the PCA analysis.
Which attribute was dropped from the analysis?
age
sex
sick
TBG
TBG measured
TT4
---
Correct answer(s):
TBG

Question 7
Examine the hypothyroid data in the Explorer’s Preprocess panel to determine why the TBG attribute was dropped.
It has a constant value across all instances
It is noisy
All its values are missing
---
Correct answer(s):
