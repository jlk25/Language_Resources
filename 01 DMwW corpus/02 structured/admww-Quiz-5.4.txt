Some Python commands 
Question 1
In Python, “lists” store a collection of different pieces of information under a single variable name. The list items are separated by commas, and the list is enclosed by square brackets.
In Weka’s Jython console, try this:
x = ['a', 'b', 'c', 1, 2, 3]
print x
print x[2]
… and click the little green arrow. (Numbering starts from 0; x[0] is ‘a’.)
Now for the question: What method is used to add an item to a list?
add
append
plus
---
Correct answer(s):
append
---
Feedback correct:
In Weka’s Jython console, try:
x = ['a','b','c',1,2,3]
x.append('d')
print x
… and click the little green arrow

Question 2
How do you delete the third item from list x?
del x[2]
delete x[2]
remove(x, 2)
---
Correct answer(s):
del x[2]
---
Feedback correct:
x = ['a','b','c',1,2,3]
del x[2]
print x

Question 3
How do you remove integer value 2 from list x = [‘a’, ‘b’, ‘c’, 1, 2, 3]?
del x[2]
del x, 2
x.remove(2)
remove(x, 2)
---
Correct answer(s):
x.remove(2)
---
Feedback correct:
x = ['a','b','c',1,2,3]
x.remove(2)
print x

Question 4
A Python “tuple” is like a list but uses parentheses rather than square brackets; in addition, unlike lists, tuples cannot be changed.
Try this:
y = ('a', 'b', 'c', 1, 2, 3)
print y
Now for the question: How do you turn list x into a tuple?
x.as_tuple()
make_tuple(x)
tuple(x)
---
Correct answer(s):
tuple(x)
---
Feedback correct:
x = ['a','b','c',1,2,3]
y = tuple(x)
print y
print x

Question 5
A Python “dictionary” is a set of key : value pairs that allow you to retrieve a value given the corresponding key; the set is enclosed in curly brackets.
Try this:
z = {1: 'hello', 2: 'world', '3': 'answer', 'a': 'is', 'this': 42}
print z[1], z[2]
Then experiment by printing z[3], z[4], z[‘3’], z[‘a’], etc.
Now for the question: How do you retrieve the value 42 from the dictionary z?
z[‘this’]
z.get(‘this’)
get(z, ‘this’)
---
Correct answer(s):
z[‘this’]
---
Feedback correct:
z = {1: 'hello', 2: 'world', '3': 'answer', 'a': 'is', 'this': 42}
print z['this']

Question 6
How can you create a copy of list x?  (There are two ways, so check 2 answers.)
Select all the answers you think are correct.
x.copy()
x[:]
copy(x)
---
Correct answer(s):
x[:]
copy(x)
---
Feedback correct:
x = ['a','b','c',1,2,3]
x1 = x[:]
print x1
copy(x) is the recommended practice for copying objects, but it requires you to first import the copy function from the standard Python library. You do this by saying “from copy import copy”.
from copy import copy
x = ['a','b','c',1,2,3]
x1 = copy(x)
print x1
---
Feedback incorrect:
x = ['a','b','c',1,2,3]
x1 = x[:]
print x1
---

x1 = copy(x)
print x1

Question 7
How can you create a copy of dictionary z?
z.copy()
z{:}
z.makecopy()
---
Correct answer(s):
z.copy()
---
Feedback correct:
from copy import copy
z = {1: 'hello', 2: 'world', '3': 'answer', 'a': 'is', 'this': 42}
z1 = z.copy()
print z1
(You don’t need the first line if  you’ve already imported copy)

Question 8
Which of these is an if-statement that checks whether the numeric value 12 is present in a list x?
Maybe you’ll just have to guess!
if x contains 12:
if x.has(12):
if 12 in x:
---
Correct answer(s):
if 12 in x:
---
Feedback correct:
x = ['a','b','c',1,2,3]
if 3 in x:
    print("3 is there!")
if 12 in x:
    print("cannot happen")
(Why doesn’t it print “cannot happen”?)

Question 9
What’s the value of the Python expression 2**4 + 2**3 + (87 % 8)?
11
21
31
---
Correct answer(s):
31
---
Feedback correct:
x = 2**4 + 2**3 + (87 % 8)
print x

Question 10
What options are required to configure the unsupervised Discretize filter to use 15 bins on the third attribute?
To find out, go to Weka’s Javadoc (in your Weka download, or here), scroll down the main list to find weka.filters.unsupervised.attribute, and within that look for Discretize.
–b 15 –a 3
–b 15 –r 3
–B 15 –C 3
–B 15 –R 3
–bin 15 –attr 3
---
Correct answer(s):
–B 15 –R 3
---
Feedback correct:
The order of B and R is irrelevant

Question 11
In Python, Weka options are specified as lists of strings, and if an option has a value it is given as a separate string.
What is the option list for configuring the unsupervised AddNoise filter to add 5% noise to the third attribute?
”[–P, 5, –C, 3]”
[–P, 5, –C, 3]
[“–P 5”, “–C 3”]
[“–P”, “5”, “–C”, “3”]
---
Correct answer(s):
