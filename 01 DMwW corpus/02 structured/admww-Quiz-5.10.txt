Showing bubble plots and ROC curves 
Question 1
Change the classifier from functions.LinearRegression to rules.ZeroR with default options (remove the setOptions line).
How do the bubbles compare with the ones generated previously for linear regression?
much the same, but all smaller
similar, but in different places
large bubbles are much the same, but small ones are all smaller
they don’t look like bubbles at all!
---
Correct answer(s):
they don’t look like bubbles at all!
---
Feedback correct:
Pretty well the whole screen is covered by the bubble color.

Question 2
Change the classifier to functions.SMOreg (a version of SMO that copes with numeric class values), again with default options.
How do the bubbles compare with the ones for linear regression?
much the same, but all smaller
similar, but in different places
large bubbles are much the same, but small ones are all smaller
they don’t look like bubbles at all
---
Correct answer(s):
large bubbles are much the same, but small ones are all smaller

Question 3
Load the display_roc-multiple.py script into the Jython console and execute it to get the ROC plot that you saw in the video (you will need to put the balance-scale.arff data file into your MOOC_DATA folder).
There are three graphs, red, blue, and green (the green line is largely obscured by the red one), and the legend at the bottom labels them as L, B, and R respectively.
What do these three different ROC curves correspond to?
B and R stands for blue and red, and L for Lime green
different class values in the data file
different learning algorithms
different parameters for the Naive Bayes algorithm
different thresholds used to calculate the ROC
---
Correct answer(s):
different class values in the data file
---
Feedback correct:
Loading balance-scale.arff into the Explorer shows that the class values are L, B, and R (corresponding to “left”, “balanced”, and “right”).

Question 4
Change the Python script to use breast-cancer.arff and run it.
You will see two curves rather than three.
Now change the program to plot a curve just for the single value classIndex = 0. (When ROC curves are used for 2-class data, usually the curve for just one class is shown.)
Ignoring changes in indentation, how many lines of code do you have to add, delete, and change (there are 3 correct answers, so for a fully correct answer you must click 3 boxes)?
Select all the answers you think are correct.
add 0, delete 0, change 1
add 0, delete 1, change 2
add 0, delete 2, change 1
add 1, delete 1, change 0
add 1, delete 4, change 2
---
Correct answer(s):
add 0, delete 0, change 1
add 0, delete 1, change 2
add 1, delete 1, change 0
---
Feedback correct:
You could change the for classIndex … line to for classIndex in [0]:
You could delete the for classIndex … line and change classIndex to 0 in two places. (You must also remove the indentation from the lines that were previously within the for-loop.)
You could delete the for classIndex … line and add a line classIndex = 0.  (You must also remove the indentation from the lines that were previously within the for-loop.)
---
Feedback incorrect:
You could change the for classIndex … line to for classIndex in [0]:
---
Feedback incorrect:
You could delete the for classIndex … line and change classIndex to 0 in two places. (You must also remove the indentation from the lines that were previously within the for-loop.)
---
Feedback incorrect:
You could delete the for classIndex … line and add a line classIndex = 0.  (You must also remove the indentation from the lines that were previously within the for-loop.)

Question 5
The value of True Positive Rate continually increases.
At approximately what value of False Positive Rate does it cross the 50% mark?
0.15
0.19
0.23
0.25
---
Correct answer(s):
0.23
---
Feedback incorrect:
That’s the value you would get for the ROC curve with classIndex = 1

Question 6
Change your program to make it print “Naive Bayes” in the legend at the bottom.
Now add code to also plot a similar ROC curve for the J48 classifier, suitably labeled.
Which of these statements best describes the relationship between the two curves?
The J48 line is always above the Naive Bayes one because J48 performs better on this data
The J48 line is always below the Naive Bayes one because J48 performs worse on this data
The J48 line starts above the Naive Bayes one and crosses below it at a False Positive Rate of about 0.5, rising above it again at about 0.9
The J48 line starts below the Naive Bayes one and crosses it at a False Positive Rate of about 0.7, falling below it again at about 0.9
---
Correct answer(s):
The J48 line starts below the Naive Bayes one and crosses it at a False Positive Rate of about 0.7, falling below it again at about 0.9

Question 7
Answer these questions by examining the Python scripts supplied with this lesson.
What class is used for cross-validating a classifier?
weka.evaluations.Evaluation
weka.classifiers.Evaluation
weka.core.Evaluation
---
Correct answer(s):
weka.classifiers.Evaluation
---
Feedback correct:
This class is imported by crossvalidate_classifier.py and display_roc-multiple.py

Question 8
How do you make a scatter plot with JFreeChart?
ChartFactory.createScatterPlot(…)
ChartFactory.makeScatterPlot(…)
ChartFactory.scatterPlot(…)
new ScatterPlot()
---
Correct answer(s):
ChartFactory.createScatterPlot(…)
---
Feedback correct:
This is used in crossvalidate_classifier-error-bubbles.py

Question 9
How do you calculate the error in a numeric prediction to be used as size for a bubble plot?
abs( pred.actual() – pred.predicted() )
pred.error()
pred.predicted() * pred.weight()
---
Correct answer(s):
abs( pred.actual() – pred.predicted() )
---
Feedback correct:
This is used in crossvalidate_classifier-error-bubbles.py
---
Feedback incorrect:
Note that pred.error() can be negative!

weka.classifiers.evaluation.ThresholdCurve

What is plotted for an ROC curve?
false negatives against true negatives
false negative rate against true negative rate
false positives against true positives
