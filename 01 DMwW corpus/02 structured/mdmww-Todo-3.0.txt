Classification rules, association rules, and clustering 
Is it better to generate rules or trees?
This week's first Big Question!

Is it better to generate rules or trees?
article
Decision trees and rules 
Any decision tree has an equivalent set of rules ... and for any set of rules there's an equivalent decision tree. But the complexities may be very different â€“ particularly if the rules are to be executed in a predetermined order.

Generating decision rules 
"PART" makes good rules by repeatedly creating partial decision trees.
Incremental reduced-error pruning is a standard pruning technique.
"Ripper" follows this by complex optimization to make very small rule sets.

Association rules 
Instead of predicting a "class", association rules describe relations between any of the attributes.
Support and Confidence are basic measures of a rule.
"Apriori" is the standard association-rule-learning algorithm.

Learning association rules 
Apriori's strategy is to specify a minimum Confidence, and iteratively reduce Support until enough rules are found.
It generates high-support "item sets" and turns them into rules.

Representing clusters 
With clustering, there is no "class" attribute. Instead of predicting the class, we try to divide the instances into natural groups, or "clusters".
There are many different representations for clusters.

Evaluating clusters
It's hard to evaluate clustering, except perhaps by visualization.
Different clustering algorithms use different metrics for optimization.
If the dataset has a "class" attribute, you can do "classes to clusters" evaluation.
