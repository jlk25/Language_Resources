LibSVM and LibLINEAR
LibLINEAR and LibSVM are Weka's most popular packages. The first contains many algorithms for linear classification: it's very fast. The second implements non-linear SVMs, and requires parameter optimization (using gridSearch).

Using R to plot data
A well-known library for R, ggplot2,
enables construction of complex plots of data using layers. The RConsole for WEKA’s Explorer can be used to execute plotting commands.

Using R to run a classifier 
The MLR library interfaces to a vast collection of classification algorithms. These can be accessed from Weka just like regular classifiers, using the MLRClassifier. Algorithm implementations can be compared using the Experimenter
